      `P = (p_i), Q = (q_i), "distance"(P,Q) = sqrt( sum_{i=1}^n (p_i -
      q_i)^2)`. The proofs of the Pythagorean metrics all depend on the local
      "flatness" of the space. Cartesian coordinate space which have Pythagorean
      metrics are called Euclidean spaces (`bbb"E"^n`). In the realm of
      coordinate reference systems, only "Engineering Coordinate Systems" are
      Euclidean. Any CRS using a curved Datum are by definition non-Euclidean,
      and cannot "truthfully" use Pythagorean metrics except for approximation.
      These approximations are valid for topological statements, but not for
      real world measures without adjustments.
