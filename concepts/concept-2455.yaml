    point in a n-dimension coordinate system using `n+1` numbers, \([u_0, u_1,
    u_2, u_3, ... , u_n] \backepsilon [[0 \leq u_i \leq 1] \wedge \sum u_i =
    1.0]\), in which the location of a point of an n-simplex (of any dimension)
    is specified by a weighted center of mass of equal masses placed at its
    vertices using vector algebra of the `RR^n` used in the coordinate reference
    system

  notes:
    - >-
      Even though there are `n+1` coordinates in a barycentric coordinate
      system, the topological dimension is n, since the restriction (sums to
      1.0) loses 1 degree of freedom (once you have n ordinates, the remaining
      one is determined such as `u_n = 1.0 − sum_(i=0)^(n-1) u_i`. he
      coordinates for the simplex are all non-negative, but the system can be
      extended outside of the simples by using negative numbers. If the
      ordinates are all positive, then the point is inside (interior to) the
      n-simplex. If one of them is 1.0 and the other 0, this is a corner of the
      simplex. If one of them is zero and the others still each greater than or
      equal to zero, the point is on the n-1-simplex opposite the vertex zeroed
      out. If any are negative, the point is outside of the simplex. The
      coordinates are dependent on the underlying coordinate reference system of
      the source data.
