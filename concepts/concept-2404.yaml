  definition: >-
    geometric reference surface embedded in 3D Euclidean space formed by an
    ellipse that is rotated about a main axis
  language_code: eng
  notes:
    - >-
      For the Earth the ellipsoid is bi-axial with rotation about the polar
      axis. This results in an oblate ellipsoid with the midpoint of the foci
      located at the nominal centre of the Earth.
