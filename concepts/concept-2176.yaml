    storage mechanism for multidimensional array in linear memory, organized
    such that each row is stored in consecutive locations and such that the
    complete rows are the stored one after the other and continuing on is a
    similar fashion of each additional index

      If the indexes are `(i, j)` with the number of rows `r` and columns `c`,
      then the mapping between the multidimensional locations to the linear
      storage locations is given by: \[[i,j \in \mathbb{Z} \backepsilon 1 \leq i
      \leq r; 1 \leq j \leq c] \implies [(i,j) \rightarrow (i-1)c + j]\]
      \[[i,j,k \in \mathbb{Z} \backepsilon 1 \leq i \leq r; 1 \leq j \leq c; 1
      \leq k \leq f] \implies [(i,j,k) \rightarrow ((i-1)c + j -1)f + k]\]

      The matrix `[[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]` in row major form is stored as `[1,
      2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`. For higher dimensions, the same pattern is
      applied recursively:
