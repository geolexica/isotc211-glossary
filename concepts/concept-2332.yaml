    reference frame describing the relation of gravity-related heights or depths
    to the Earth

  notes:

      In most cases, the vertical reference frame will be related to mean sea
      level. Vertical datums include sounding datums (used for hydrographic
      purposes), in which case the heights may be negative heights or depths.
    - >-
      Ellipsoidal heights are related to a three-dimensional ellipsoidal
      coordinate system referenced to a geodetic reference frame.
