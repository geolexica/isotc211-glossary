      The mail recipient is normally the addressee, the mailee or an authorized
      representative of one of these two. However, this might not always be the
      case, e.g. if the postal item is left for collection in a location to
      which third parties have access; if the addressee/mailee have moved
      without leaving forwarding instructions or if the addressee or mailee
      specification was ambiguous and was, as a result, misinterpreted by the
      postal operator
