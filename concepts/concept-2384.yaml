  definition: >-
    geometric complex where the geometric primitives are in a 1-to-1
    correspondence to the topological primitives of a topological complex, such
    that the boundary relations in the two complexes agree
  language_code: eng
  notes:
    - >-
      In such a realization, the topological primitives are considered to
      represent the interiors of the corresponding geometric primitives even
      though the primitives themselves are closed.
