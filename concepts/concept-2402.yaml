  id: 2402
  definition: >-
    coordinate reference system that is defined through the application of a
    specified coordinate conversion to the coordinates within a previously
    established coordinate reference system
  language_code: eng
  notes:
    - >-
      The previously established coordinate reference system is referred to as
      the base coordinate reference system.
    - >-
      A derived coordinate reference system inherits its datum or reference
      frame from its base coordinate reference system.
    - >-
      The coordinate conversion between the base and derived coordinate
      reference system is implemented using the parameters and formula(s)
      specified in the definition of the coordinate conversion.
