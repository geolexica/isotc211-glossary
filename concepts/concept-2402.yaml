  - type: expression
    normative_status: preferred
    designation: derived coordinate reference system
  definition:
  - content: coordinate reference system that is defined through the application of
      a specified coordinate conversion to the coordinates within a previously established
      coordinate reference system
  notes:
  - content: The previously established coordinate reference system is referred to
      as the base coordinate reference system.
  - content: A derived coordinate reference system inherits its datum or reference
      frame from its base coordinate reference system.
  - content: The coordinate conversion between the base and derived coordinate reference
      system is implemented using the parameters and formula(s) specified in the definition
      of the coordinate conversion.
