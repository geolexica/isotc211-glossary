  definition: height that is dependent on the Earth’s gravity field
  language_code: eng
  notes:
  - This refers to, amongst others, orthometric height and Normal height, which are
    both approximations of the distance of a point above the mean sea level, but also
    may include Normal-orthometric heights, dynamic heights or geopotential numbers.
  - The distance from the reference surface may follow a curved line, not necessarily
    straight, as it is influenced by the direction of gravity.
