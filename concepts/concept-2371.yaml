term: gravity-related height
termid: 2371

  id: 2371
  abbrev: H
  definition: height that is dependent on the Earth’s gravity field
  language_code: eng
  notes:
    - >-
      This refers to, amongst others, orthometric height and Normal height,
      which are both approximations of the distance of a point above the mean
      sea level, but also may include Normal-orthometric heights, dynamic
      heights or geopotential numbers.
    - >-
      The distance from the reference surface may follow a curved line, not
      necessarily straight, as it is influenced by the direction of gravity.
