  definition: >-
    coordinate operation that changes coordinates in a source coordinate
    reference system to coordinates in a target coordinate reference system in
    which the source and target coordinate reference systems are based on
    different datums
  language_code: eng
  notes:
    - >-
      A coordinate transformation uses parameters which are derived empirically.
      Any error in those coordinates will be embedded in the coordinate
      transformation and when the coordinate transformation is applied the
      embedded errors are transmitted to output coordinates.
    - >-
      A coordinate transformation is colloquially sometimes referred to as a
      'datum transformation'. This is erroneous. A coordinate transformation
      changes coordinate values. It does not change the definition of the datum.
      In this document coordinates are referenced to a coordinate reference
      system. A coordinate transformation operates between two coordinate
      reference systems, not between two datums.
