  notes:
  - "\\[[\\forall a \\in A \\implies max(A) \\geq a] \\implies [\\forall b \\ni [(b
    \\ni [\\forall a \\in A \\implies b \\geq a] \\implies [max(a) \\leq b]]\\] Any
    number is an upper bound of `O/` (empty set) as a set of numbers, because any
    given number is greater than any number in `O/` (an admitted vacuous statement
    since there is no number in `O/`, but true nonetheless). This means that the `max(O/)`
    must be smaller than any number; thus `-oo`."
