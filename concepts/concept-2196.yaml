    SAR sensor enhanced by transmitting and receiving in different combinations
    of polarization

      By combining multiple polarization modes, it is possible to characterize
      the target more clearly. Quad-Pol SAR system both transmits and receives
      orthogonal (e.g. horizontal and vertical) polarizations, which creates
      four polarizations of a single imaging scene. The calibration of Quad-Pol
      SAR is addressed in this document.
