    designation: ellipsoid <geodesy>
  definition:
  - content: geometric reference surface embedded in 3D Euclidean space formed by
      an ellipse that is rotated about a main axis
  notes:
  - content: For the Earth the ellipsoid is bi-axial with rotation about the polar
      axis. This results in an oblate ellipsoid with the midpoint of the foci located
      at the nominal centre of the Earth.
