      This definition (as opposed to the one in ISO 19162:2015) is required for
      this document  because the concept is used in other definitions, such as
      first geodetic problem and second geodetic problem. The two definitions
      are nearly equivalent because the tangent of a curve on a surface is a
      tangent to the surface and does specify a direction. Usual 2D measure of
      bearing can be an angle equivalently measured from North clockwise, or a
      unit tangent vector. If the coordinate system is spatially 3D, the
      horizontal bearing angle may also need to a vertical altitude angle to be
      complete. If a reference curve (as used in ISO 19162) is parameterized by
      arc length, then the "derivative" is a unit vector. If another
      parameterization `t` is used, then the derivative should be normalized
      (`vec tau / (norm (vec tau)); dot c(t) = vec tau;`). This is useful, since
      parameterization by arc length can be computationally difficult. The
      numeric representation of a vector depends on the coordinate system. The
      bearing is not dependent on a coordinate system, but it can be represented
      in any reasonable system. The bearing is not dependent on its various
      representations.
