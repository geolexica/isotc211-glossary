    common root classifier of a category which is a superclass of any other
    classifier in the category

      The class Any in some programming languages is the abstract root of all
      classes. Thus, it is the de facto union of all classes. In this document,
      Geometry is the (named and explicit) abstract root for all geometry
      objects. In the package Geometry and any of its subpackages (including
      those in its Requirements Classes), any interface will be a subtype of
      Geometry either directly or transitively.
