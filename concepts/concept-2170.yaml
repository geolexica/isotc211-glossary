      An increasing sequence never gets smaller. A strictly increasing sequence
      always gets larger. A decreasing sequence never gets larger. A strictly
      decreasing sequence always gets smaller. `[x(i) "is increasing"] hArr [i <
      j => x(i) <= x(j)]` `[x(i) "is strickly increasing"] hArr [i < j => x(i) <
      x(j)]` `[x(i) text( is decreasing)] hArr [i < j => x(i) >= x(j)]` `[x(i)
      text( is strickly decreasing)] hArr [i < j => x(i) > x(j)]` `[x(i) text(
      is decreasing)] vv [x(i) text( is increasing)] hArr [x(i) text( is
      monotonic)]`
