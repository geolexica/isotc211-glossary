      If `c(s) = (x(s), y(s), z(s))` is a curve in a 3D Cartesian space
      (`bbb"E"^3`), and `s` is arc length along `c`, then the tangent is `vec
      tau(s) = dot c(s) = (dot x(s), dot y(s), dot z(s))`, i.e. the derivative
      of the coordinate values of `c` with respect to `s`. The curvature vector
      is `kappa(s) = ddot c(s) = (ddot x(s), ddot y(s), ddot z(s))`.
