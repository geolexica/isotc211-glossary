  terms:
  - type: expression
    normative_status: preferred
    designation: topological boundary <geometry, topology>
  definition:
  - content: boundary represented by a set of oriented topological primitives of smaller
      topological dimension that limits the extent of a topological object, or by
      the geometric realization of such a set
  notes:
  - content: The boundary of a topological complex is the boundary of the geometric
      realization of the topological complex.
