  definition: >-
    boundary represented by a set of oriented topological primitives of smaller
    topological dimension that limits the extent of a topological object, or by
    the geometric realization of such a set
  language_code: eng
  notes:
    - >-
      The boundary of a topological complex is the boundary of the geometric
      realization of the topological complex.
