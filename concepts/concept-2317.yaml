  definition: >-
    coordinate reference system derived from a geographic coordinate reference
    system by applying a map projection

      May be two- or three-dimensional, the dimension being equal to that of the
      geographic coordinate reference system from which it is derived.
    - >-
      In the three-dimensional case the horizontal coordinates (geodetic
      latitude and geodetic longitude coordinates) are projected to northing and
      easting and the ellipsoidal height is unchanged.
