  definition: >-
    realization of a terrestrial reference system (TRS), by specifying its
    origin, orientation, scale, and its time evolution
  language_code: eng
  notes:
    - >-
      The realization is achieved through a set of physical points with
      precisely determined coordinates in a specific coordinate system, which
      may include the rate of coordinate change.
    - >-
      The realization is called static when no rates of coordinate change are
      defined, and kinematic when rates of coordinate change are defined without
      considering the underlying forces causing the motion. The realization may
      be called dynamic when these external forces are considered. "Dynamic" is
      also used colloquially to describe both the dynamic and kinematic cases
      without distinction.
