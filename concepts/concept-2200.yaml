    power

      Radar cross section is calculated as `sigma = lim_(R ->oo) 4 pi R^2
      (abs(E_s)^2) / (abs(E_i)^2)` where `sigma` is the radar cross section;
      `E_i` is the electric-field strength of the incident wave; `E_s` is the
      electric-field strength of the scattered wave at the radar with a distance
      `R` away from the target.
    - "\_2 to entry: Radar cross section has the dimensions of area, with the unit of square metres. Usually, it is expressed in the form of a logarithm with the unit of dBsm as follows `sigma_(dBsm) = 10 log_(10) sigma`"
