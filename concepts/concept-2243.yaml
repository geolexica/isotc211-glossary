      The normal curvature vector of a curve is dependent only on the curve and
      the surface (which is a constraint on the curve). The normal curvature
      vector of a curve restricted to a surface is parallel to the normal vector
      of the surface. If the normal curvature vector is equal to the curvature
      vector of the curve everywhere, then the curve is a geodesic.
