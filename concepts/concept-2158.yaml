      Sets are equal if they contain exactly the same elements. Since any two
      empty sets would share exactly the same contained elements (by definition
      none), they are, by definition, equal. The empty set (∅) can be considered
      a geometric entity, because all the elements it contains are points. This
      is a vacuous statement since the set ∅ contains no elements, and therefore
      the "for all" statement has nothing to test and is thus true in each of
      its non-existent cases. There are a lot of true but vacuous statements in
      proofs about ∅. This confuses some programmers since many systems use type
      safe sets, in which the class of the entities determines a class for the
      container set. The math does not care about "class" and only sees sets; so
      that an empty set of aardvarks and an empty set of zebras in mathematics
      are (is?) the same set. The other confusion is that ∅ is not the database
      Null introduced by Codd and used in relational and other query languages
      in 3 valued logic. Null means unknown and many statements involving Null
      are undecidable (neither provably true nor provably false). The empty set
      is not "lack of knowledge" but certainty in the nonexistence of elements
      in the set. Most statements beginning "for all elements in ∅" are true,
      but vacuous. Most statements beginning "there exist an element in ∅" are
      always categorically false. It is almost impossible to construct an
      undecidable statement about ∅. Null and ∅ are not related. "Void" can mean
      "invalid" or "completely empty."
