  definition:
  - content: bounded spatial object with an empty boundary
  notes:
  - content: Cycles are used to describe boundary components. A cycle usually has
      no boundary because it closes on itself, but it is bounded (i.e., it does not
      have infinite extent). A circle or a sphere, for example, has no boundary (i.e.,
      its boundary is empty), but is bounded.
