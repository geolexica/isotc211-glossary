      Point and DirectPosition are informationally identical (related to each
      other in a one to one fashion) in this context. Given a DirectPosition, a
      Point can be constructed. Given a Point, a DirectPosition can be derived
      from of its coordinates. If coercion is supported, a Point may be used
      where a DirectPosition is requested, and vice versa. Most programming
      languages use coercion, but others use "cast" operators (a type of
      constructor) requiring the programmer to initiate the coercion. "Strong
      substantiality" is related in that a subtype instance can always be
      coerced to any of its supertypes.
