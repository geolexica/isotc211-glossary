      \[[\forall a \in A \implies max(A) \geq a] \implies [\forall b \ni [(b \ni
      [\forall a \in A \implies b \geq a] \implies [max(a) \leq b]]\] Any number
      is an upper bound of `O/` (empty set) as a set of numbers, because any
      given number is greater than any number in `O/` (an admitted vacuous
      statement since there is no number in `O/`, but true nonetheless). This
      means that the `max(O/)` must be smaller than any number; thus `-oo`.
