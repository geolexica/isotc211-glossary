  definition:
  - content: number of independent decisions in a coordinate system required to locate
      a position
  notes:
  - content: This definition is logically equivalent to the topological dimension
      of spatial projection of the CRS. It describes the space as a target for geometry.
      Grammatically, the term can be a noun but used to describe space, as "the spatial
      dimension of CRS84 is 2".
