    number of independent decisions in a coordinate system required to locate a
    position

    - >-
      This definition is logically equivalent to the topological dimension of
      spatial projection of the CRS. It describes the space as a target for
      geometry. Grammatically, the term can be a noun but used to describe
      space, as "the spatial dimension of CRS84 is 2".
