      The geodesic circles centred on a pole (either one) are the lines of
      constant latitude. Circles in a tangent space centred on the origin
      (corresponding to the point of tangency) map to geodesic circles by the
      exponential map on the geometric reference surface centred on the point of
      tangency.
