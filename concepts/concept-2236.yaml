      `[AA a in A => min(A) <= a] => [AA b in [(b in [AA a in A => b <=a] =>
      [min(A) >= b]]` Any number is a lower bound of `O/` considered as a set of
      numbers, because any given number is less than any number in `O/` (an
      admitted vacuous statement since there is no number in `O/`, but true
      nonetheless). This means that the `min(O/)` must be greater than any
      number; this `+oo`.
