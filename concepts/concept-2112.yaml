      The addressee may be explicitly defined as part of the postal address, or
      may be implicit. For example, in certain countries, omission of addressee
      information is taken as implying that delivery is to be to an individual
      or legal entity having legal access to the delivery point.
    - >-
      Mr. or Mrs. Smith specifies that the addressee is either of two
      individuals, while Mr. Jones and Mrs. Smith denote that the addressee is a
      group of two individuals. See also role descriptor.
    - >-
      The use made by the postal operator of addressee and mailee data might be
      dependent on the postal service applicable to the postal item. For some
      services, such as registered mail, the postal operator’s responsibility
      might include ensuring that the addressee or a duly authorized
      representative acknowledges receipt of the postal item. In other cases,
      addressee data could be purely informative or used by the postal operator
      only for consistency checking and/or for the activation of forwarding
      services. In other cases, it might be used for sorting or sequencing
      purposes prior to delivery, e.g. in the case of business mail being
      pre-sequenced by department or individual company official.
    - >-
      In some countries, the addressee may be an abstraction such as “postal
      customer”.
