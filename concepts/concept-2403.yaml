  definition:
  - content: coordinate reference system that has a dynamic reference frame
  notes:
  - content: Coordinates of points on or near the crust of the Earth that are referenced
      to a dynamic coordinate reference system may change with time, usually due to
      crustal deformations such as tectonic motion and glacial isostatic adjustment.
  - content: Metadata for a dataset referenced to a dynamic coordinate reference system
      should include coordinate epoch information.
