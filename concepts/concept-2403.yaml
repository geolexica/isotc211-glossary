  notes:
    - >-
      Coordinates of points on or near the crust of the Earth that are
      referenced to a dynamic coordinate reference system may change with time,
      usually due to crustal deformations such as tectonic motion and glacial
      isostatic adjustment.
    - >-
      Metadata for a dataset referenced to a dynamic coordinate reference system
      should include coordinate epoch information.
