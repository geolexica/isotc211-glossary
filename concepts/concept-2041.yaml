      If `c(s) = (x(s), y(s), z(s))` is a curve in a 3D Cartesian space
      (`bbb"E"^3`), and `s` is the arc length along `c(s)`, then the unit
      tangent vector is `dot c(s) = (dot x(s), dot y(s), dot z(s))`, i.e. the
      derivative of the coordinate values of `c` with respect to `s`. The
      curvature vector is `ddot c(s) = (ddot x(s), ddot y(s), ddot z(s))`. The
      curvature vector can be approximated by the inverse of the radius of a
      circle through any 3 nearby points on the curve (pointed from the curve to
      towards the centre of the circle)
