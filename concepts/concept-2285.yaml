    normative_status: preferred
    designation: integrated side lobe ratio
  definition:
  - content: ratio between the side lobe power and the main lobe power of the impulse
      response of point targets in the radar imaging scene
  notes:
  - content: The integrated side lobe ratio (ISLR) can be obtained by integrating
      the power of the impulse response over suitable regions. The ISLRis expressed
      as  `ISLR = 10log_(10) {(P_(text(total))-P_(text(main)))/(P_(text(main)))}`
      where `P_(text(total))` is the total power, `P_(text(main))` is the main lobe
      power.
  - content: The main lobe width can be taken as α times the impulse response width
      (IRW), centred around the peak, where α is a predefined constant, usually between
      2 and 2,5.
