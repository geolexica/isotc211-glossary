  definition: >-
    ratio between the side lobe power and the main lobe power of the impulse
    response of point targets in the radar imaging scene

  notes:
    - >-
      The integrated side lobe ratio (ISLR) can be obtained by integrating the
      power of the impulse response over suitable regions. The ISLRis expressed
      as  `ISLR = 10log_(10)
      {(P_(text(total))-P_(text(main)))/(P_(text(main)))}` where 
      `P_(text(total))` is the total power, `P_(text(main))` is the main lobe
      power.
    - >-
      The main lobe width can be taken as α times the impulse response width
      (IRW), centred around the peak, where α is a predefined constant, usually
      between 2 and 2,5.
