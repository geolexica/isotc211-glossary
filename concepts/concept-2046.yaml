  definition: minimal length of a curve that joins the two points or geometries

      The usual distance function for two points in a coordinate space assumes
      an underlying plane and is a Euclidean distance. If the underlying
      Reference Surface is not a plane, then distance is defined by this minimum
      length of all curves between the two points. These surfaces are prime
      examples of non-Euclidean geometry, where the parallel postulate in
      Euclid's Elements does not hold. In mathematical terms, distance is the
      "greatest lower bound" of the length of the curves. The word minimum is
      sometimes used, but there should be no expectation that an instance of
      that minimum actually occurs, only that any larger number will have a
      length in the set that is smaller.
