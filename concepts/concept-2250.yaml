    homogeneous (all points have isomorphic neighborhoods) and with a simple
    boundary

      The interior is everywhere locally isomorphic to an open disc in a
      Euclidean coordinate space of the appropriate dimension `D^n = {P | norm P
      < 1.0}`. The boundary is a dimension one smaller. This essentially means
      that the object does not intersect nor touch itself. Generally used for a
      curve that does not cross not touch itself with the possible exception of
      boundary points. Simple closed curves are isomorphic to a circle.
