      A homomorphism is distinct from a isomorphism in that no inverse function
      is required. In an isomorphism, there are two homomorphisms that are
      functional inverses of one another. Continuous functions are topological
      homomorphisms because they preserve "topological characteristics". The
      mapping of topological complexes to their geometric realizations preserves
      the concept of boundary and is therefore a homomorphism.
