      Geometric primitives are non-decomposed objects that present information
      about geometric configuration. They include points, curves, surfaces, and
      solids. Many geometric objects behave like primitives (supporting the same
      interfaces defined for geometric primitives) but are actually composites
      composed of some number of other primitives. General collections may be
      aggregates and incapable of acting like a primitive (such as the lines of
      a complex network, which is not connected and thus incapable of being
      traceable as a single line). By this definition, a geometric primitive is
      topological open, since the boundary points are not isotropic to the
      interior points. Geometry is assumed to be closed. For points, the
      boundary is empty.
