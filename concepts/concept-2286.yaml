term: peak side lobe ratio
termid: 2286

  id: 2286
  abbrev: PSLR
  definition: >-
    ratio between the peak power of the largest side lobe and the peak power of
    the main lobe of the impulse response of point targets in the SAR image
  language_code: eng
  notes:
    - >-
      The peak side lobe ratio is usually expressed in decibels (dB) and
      computed as follows `PSLR = 10log_(10)
      {(P_(text(sidepeak)))/(P_(text(mainpeak)))}` where `P_(text(mainpeak))` is
      the peak power of the main lobe; `P_(text(sidepeak))` is the peak power of
      the largest side lobe.
