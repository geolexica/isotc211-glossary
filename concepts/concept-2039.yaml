      The coordinate dimension represents the number of choices made, and
      constraints can restrict choices. A barycentric coordinate which has
      (n+1)-offsets, but the underlying space is dimension n. Homogeneous
      coordinates (wx, wy, wz, w) are actually 3 dimensional because the choice
      of "w" does not affect the position, i.e. (wx, wy, wz, w) = (x y, z, 1) →
      (x, y, z) which is not affected by w. The dimension will be at most the
      count of the numbers in the coordinate, but it can be less if the
      coordinates are constrained in some manner.asie
