    party designated in a postal address as having responsibility for ensuring
    that postal items reach their addressee
  language_code: eng
  notes:
    - >-
      Unlike the addressee, the mailee is always specified explicitly in a
      postal address, i.e. if a postal address does not contain a mailee, then
      there is no mailee.
    - >-
      Notwithstanding Note 1 to entry, the mailee may be designated explicitly
      by use of a role descriptor or designated implicitly with no role
      descriptor.
    - >-
      As is the case for addressee, a mailee specified in a postal address might
      be ambiguous.
