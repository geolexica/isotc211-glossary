  - type: expression
    normative_status: preferred
    designation: coordinate conversion
  definition:
  - content: coordinate operation that changes coordinates in a source coordinate
      reference system to coordinates in a target coordinate reference system in which
      both coordinate reference systems are based on the same datum
  notes:
  - content: A coordinate conversion uses parameters which have specified values.
  examples:
  - content: A mapping of ellipsoidal coordinates to Cartesian coordinates using a
      map projection.
  - content: Change of units such as from radians to degrees or from feet to metres.
