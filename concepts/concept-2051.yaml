  - type: expression
    normative_status: preferred
    designation: exponential map <differential geometry>
  definition:
  - content: function that maps tangent vectors at a point to end point of geodesic
      beginning at that point with an exit bearing equal to that of the vector and
      a length equal to that of the vector
  notes:
  - content: See first geodetic problem for an explanation of the process of calculating
      this mapping.
