  definition:
  - content: reference frame describing the relation of gravity-related heights or
      depths to the Earth
  notes:
  - content: In most cases, the vertical reference frame will be related to mean sea
      level. Vertical datums include sounding datums (used for hydrographic purposes),
      in which case the heights may be negative heights or depths.
  - content: Ellipsoidal heights are related to a three-dimensional ellipsoidal coordinate
      system referenced to a geodetic reference frame.
