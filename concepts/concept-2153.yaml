    property of a geometric object implying that any two points on the object
    can be placed on a curve that remains totally within the object

  notes:
    - >-
      There are more general geometries that are connected but not path
      connected, but they are not representable as collections of  "digital"
      geometries defined in this document. No geometric objects constructible by
      the methods in this document on a standard digital computer can be
      connected but not path connected. See the notes at the term "connected"
