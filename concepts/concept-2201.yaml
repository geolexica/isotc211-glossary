      Scattering matrix is defined via `((E_H^s),(E_V^s)) = e^(jkR)/R
      ([S_(HH),S_(HV)], [S_(VH), S_(VV)])((E_H^j), (E_V^j))` where
      `([S_(HH),S_(HV)], [S_(VH), S_(VV)])` is the scattering matrix; `((E_H^j),
      (E_V^j))` is the electronic field vector of the wave incident on the
      scatterer; `((E_H^s), (E_V^s))` is the electronic field vector of the
      scattered wave; `k` is the wavenumber of the illuminating wave; `R` is the
      distance between the target and the radar antenna.
