  definition: >-
    problem that given a point on a surface and the direction and distance from
    that point to a second point along a geodesic, determines that second point
  language_code: eng
  notes:
    - >-
      This "problem" defines a mapping from the vector space at a point (each
      vector given by a direction and a length) to points of the Figure of Earth
      that satisfy the problem for that direction and distance. For example, if
      we fix the distance "r" and take all directions, the resultant geometry is
      the circle centred at the original point of radius "r". This document will
      make heavy use of this mapping; see exponential map and the second
      geodetic problem.
