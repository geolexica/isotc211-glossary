      Some projections are conformal. For example, a Mercator preserves the
      angle between curves, so that if two curves in a Mercator projected plane
      cross at a 90°, then the preimage curves on the ellipsoid also cross at
      90°, such as lines of constant latitude and lines of constant longitude.
