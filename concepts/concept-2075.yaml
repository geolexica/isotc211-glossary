      An n-simplex is n-dimensional, and is topological isomorphic to an n-disc.
      A 0-simplex is a point. A 1-simplex is a curve (usually a line) with two
      0-simplexes (points) on its boundary; a 2-simplex is a triangular surface
      with three 1-simplices on its boundary. In general, an n-simplex boundary
      will have n (n−1)-simplexes. An n-simplex and an n-disc are topologically
      isomorphic. The boundary of an n-simplex is isomorphic to an (n−1)-sphere.
      In all cases, the number prefix represents the topological dimension of
      the object.
