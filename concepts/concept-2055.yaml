  definition: curve on a surface with a zero-length tangential curvature vector
  language_code: eng
  notes:
    - >-
      A geodesic's curvature vector is perpendicular the surface thus has the
      minimum curvature of any curve restricted to the surface. This is often
      defined as a minimal distance curve between two points, but this does not
      always suffice, since some points (especially on ellipsoids and spheres)
      are often joined by more than one geodesic. For example, on an ellipsoid
      the points with (φ, λ) = (0, 0) and (0, 180) are joined by four separate
      geodesic [2 polar (the shorter) and 2 equatorial]. The exponential map is
      only guaranteed to be one-to-one for a small area (depending on where the
      centre is and how the surface is curved).
