      In a metric space, a set `X` us open if each point `x` in the set is
      contained in some small ball which is a subset of \(X:\) \([X \text{ is
      open}] \Leftrightarrow [x \in X] \implies [\exists \varepsilon > 0
      \backepsilon \text{distance} (x,y) < \varepsilon] \implies [y \in X]\). A
      topology is a set of subsets of a space which are considered open.
