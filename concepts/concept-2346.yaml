      If the radar return from the illuminated area is contributed by a number
      of independent scattering elements, it is described by the backscattering
      coefficient instead of radar cross section used for the point target. It
      is calculated as `sigma^0 = sigma/A` Where `sigma` is the total radar
      cross section of an area `A`. `sigma^0` is a dimesionless parameter and is
      usually expressed in decibels (dB) as follows: `sigma_(dB)^0 = 10 log_(10)
      sigma^0`

      “Backscattering coefficient” is sometimes called “normalized radar cross
      section”.
