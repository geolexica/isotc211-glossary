  - type: expression
    normative_status: preferred
    designation: tangent <differential geometry, calculus>
  definition:
  - content: direction indicating the instantaneous direction of a curve at a point
  notes:
  - content: The tangent is usually calculated by differentiation of a functional
      representation of a curve but it may be approximated by a secant (double intersection)
      line from the point passing through another nearby point on the curve. The closer
      the second point is to the first, the better the approximation of the tangent's
      direction.
