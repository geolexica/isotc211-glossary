    geometric reference surface embedded in 3D Euclidean space represented by an
    ellipsoid of revolution where the rotation is about the polar axis

      For the Earth the rotation is about the polar axis. This results in an
      oblate ellipsoid with midpoint of the foci located at the nominal centre
      of the Earth.

      The two usual algorithms for latitude on an ellipsoid and on a sphere
      (such as used in spherical coordinates) are only equivalent if the
      ellipsoid is a sphere, having all radii equal in all directions. The
      problem is that a radial line from the centre of a general ellipsoid does
      not always cross the surface of the ellipsoid orthogonally. In general,
      planar slices through the centre do not intersect the surface
      orthogonally, and therefore the curves that correspond to the great
      circles of a sphere are not geodesics on the ellipsoid.
    - "The topology of the ellipsoid is inherited from the \U0001D53C3 space in which it is embedded. The difference is that metrics such as distance and direction on the ellipsoid are restricted to curves wholly on the surface and vectors tangent to the surface.at"
