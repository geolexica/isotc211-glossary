      Curves, because they are continuous images of a portion of the real line,
      have geometric dimension 1. Surfaces cannot always be mapped to `RR^2` in
      their entirety, but around each point position, a small neighborhood can
      be found that resembles (under continuous functions) the interior of the
      unit circle in `RR^2`, and are therefore 2-dimensional. In this document,
      most surfaces (instances of Surface) are mapped to portions of `RR^2` by
      their defining interpolation mechanisms.
