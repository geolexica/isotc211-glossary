  definition: >-
    set of conventions defining the origin, scale, orientation and time
    evolution of a spatial reference system co-rotating with the Earth in its
    diurnal motion in space

  notes:
    - >-
      The abstract concept of a TRS is realised through a terrestrial reference
      frame that usually consists of a set of physical points with precisely
      determined coordinates and optionally their rates of change. In this
      document terrestrial reference frame is included within the geodetic
      reference frame element of the data model.
