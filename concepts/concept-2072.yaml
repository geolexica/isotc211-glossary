      \[[\forall a \in A \implies min(A) \leq a] \implies [\forall b \ni [(b \ni
      [\forall a \in A \implies b \leq a] \implies [min(A) \geq b]]\] Any number
      is a lower bound of `O/` considered as a set of numbers, because any given
      number is less than any number in `O/` (an admitted vacuous statement
      since there is no number in `O/`, but true nonetheless). This means that
      the `min(O/)` must be greater than any number; this `+oo`.
