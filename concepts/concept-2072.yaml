  - content: "\\[[\\forall a \\in A \\implies min(A) \\leq a] \\implies [\\forall
      b \\ni [(b \\ni [\\forall a \\in A \\implies b \\leq a] \\implies [min(A) \\geq
      b]]\\] Any number is a lower bound of `O/` considered as a set of numbers, because
      any given number is less than any number in `O/` (an admitted vacuous statement
      since there is no number in `O/`, but true nonetheless). This means that the
      `min(O/)` must be greater than any number; this `+oo`."
