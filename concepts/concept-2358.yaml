    group of multiple realizations of the same terrestrial or vertical reference
    system that, for approximate spatial referencing purposes, are not
    significantly different

  notes:

      Datasets referenced to the different realizations within a datum ensemble
      may be merged without coordinate transformation.

      'Approximate' is for users to define and typically is in the order of
      under 1 decimetre but may be up to 2 metres.

      WGS 84 as an undifferentiated group of realizations including WGS 84
      (TRANSIT), WGS 84 (G730), WGS 84 (G873), WGS 84 (G1150), WGS 84 (G1674)
      and WGS 84 (G1762). At the surface of the Earth these have changed on
      average by 0.7 m between the TRANSIT and G730 realizations, a further 0.2
      m between G730 and G873, 0.06 m between G873 and G1150, 0.2 m between
      G1150 and G1674 and 0.02 m between G1674 and G1762).
