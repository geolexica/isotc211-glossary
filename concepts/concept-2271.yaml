      Digital migration is distinguished from transfers in general by three
      attributes:  — a focus on the preservation of the full information content
      that needs preservation; —  a perspective that the new archival
      implementation of the information is a replacement for the old; —  an
      understanding that full control and responsibility over all aspects of the
      transfer resides with the OAIS.
