      For PolSAR sensor, if the transmitting channel is horizontally (H)
      polarized, the cross-talk on transmitting defines the ratio of V
      polarization transmitting power to H polarization transmitting power,
      expressed in decibels (dB). The cross-talk on receiving is similar to that
      on transmitting.
