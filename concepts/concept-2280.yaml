      Representation information for a bit sequence which is a FITS file might
      consist of the FITS standard which defines the format plus a dictionary
      which defines the meaning in the file of keywords which are not part of
      the standard.
    - >-
      JPEG software which is used to render a JPEG file; rendering the JPEG file
      as bits is not very meaningful to humans but the software, which embodies
      an understanding of the JPEG standard, maps the bits into pixels which can
      then be rendered as an image for human viewing.
