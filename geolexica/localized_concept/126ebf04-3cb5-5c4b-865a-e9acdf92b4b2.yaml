  definition:
  - content: coordinate reference system for the positions in a grid that uses a defined
      coordinate system congruent with the coordinate system described by the GridEnvelope
      and axisLabels of gml:GridType
  examples: []
  id: '1376'
  notes:
  - content: A grid CRS uses a defined coordinate system with the same grid point
      positions and origin as the GridEnvelope, with the same axisLabels, but need
      not define any limits on the grid size. This coordinate system is sometimes
      called the internal grid coordinate system.
