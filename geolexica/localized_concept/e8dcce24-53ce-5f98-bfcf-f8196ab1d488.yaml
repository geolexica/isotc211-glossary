  notes:
  - content: Geocoding usually refers to the translation of "address" or "intersection"
      to "direct position." Many services providers also include a "reverse geocoding"
      interface to their geocoder, thus extending the definition of the service as
      a general translator of location. Because routing services use internal location
      encodings not usually available to others, a geocoder is an integral part of
      the internals of such a service.
