  notes:
  - content: There are more general geometries that are connected but not path connected,
      but they are not representable as collections of  "digital" geometries defined
      in this document. No geometric objects constructible by the methods in this
      document on a standard digital computer can be connected but not path connected.
      See the notes at the term "connected"
