      antenna-collecting aperture

  notes:
  - content: For the purpose of this document, the noise equivalent delta temperature
      (NEDT) values shall be defined as the standard deviation of the radiometer output
      in K when the antenna is viewing a 300 K uniform and stable target. For microwave
      radiometer, this is also called radiometric resolution.
  - content: The formula relative to sensitivity is shown in D.2.
