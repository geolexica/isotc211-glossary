  definition:
  - content: |-
      physical radiance of an absorber determined by applying Planck's function (either in wavelength space or in terms of frequencies) to absorber temperature, stem:[T_"w"], as shown in the following formula (in frequency space): stem:[I_"bb,v"=(2"h"v^3)/(c^2)1/(e^(("h"v)/("k"T_"w"))-1)]

      where

      stem:[T_"w"] is the temperature of the absorber;
      stem:["h"] is the Plank’s constant (stem:[6.62607xx10^(-34) "J" cdot "s"]);
      stem:[v] is the frequency in Hz;
      stem:["c"] is the velocity of light (stem:[2.997925xx10^8 "m"//"s"]);
      stem:["k"] is the Boltzmann’s constant (stem:[1.38064852xx10^(-23) "J"//"K"]);
      stem:["e"] is the base of natural logarithm.
