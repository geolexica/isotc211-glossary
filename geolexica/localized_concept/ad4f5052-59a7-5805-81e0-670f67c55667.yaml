  definition:
  - content: |-
      perfect absorber (and therefore the best possible emitter) of thermal electromagnetic radiation, whose spectral radiance density (or spectral brightness density, stem:[L_"f"]) is given by the Planck formula stem:[L_"f"=(2"h"nu^3)/("c"^2(e^("h"nu//"k"T)-1))]

      where

      stem:[v] is the frequency in Hz;
      stem:["h"] is Planck’s constant (stem:[6.62607xx10^(-34) "J" cdot "s"]);
      stem:["k"] is Boltzmann’s constant (stem:[1.38064852xx10^(-23) "J"//"K"]);
      stem:[T] is physical temperature of the blackbody in K;
      stem:["c"] is velocity of light (stem:[2.997925xx10^8 "m"//"s"]).
      stem:["e"] is the base of natural logarithm
