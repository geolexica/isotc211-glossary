  definition:
  - content: non-negative quantity of time equal to the difference between the final
      and initial instants of a time interval
  examples: []
  id: '2556'
  notes:
  - content: "The duration is one of the base quantities in the International System
      of Quantities (ISQ) on which the International System of Units (SI) is based.
      The term \"time\"\x9D instead of \"duration\"\x9D is often used in this context
      and also for an infinitesimal duration."
  - content: "For the term \"duration\"\x9D, expressions such as \"time\"\x9D or \"time
      interval\"\x9D are often used, but the term \"time\"\x9D is not recommended
      in this sense and the term \"time interval\"\x9D is deprecated in this sense
      to avoid confusion with the concept of \"time interval\"\x9D."
  - content: The exact duration of a time scale unit depends on the time scale used.
      For example, the durations of a year, month, week, day, hour or minute, may
      depend on when they occur [in a Gregorian calendar, a calendar month can have
      a duration of 28, 29, 30, or 31 days; in a 24-hour clock, a clock minute can
      have a duration of 59, 60, or 61 seconds, etc.]. Therefore, the exact duration
      can only be evaluated if the exact duration of each is known.
  - content: "This definition is closely related to NOTE 1 of the terminological entry
      \"duration\"\x9D in IEC 60050-113:2011, 113\"“01\"“13."
