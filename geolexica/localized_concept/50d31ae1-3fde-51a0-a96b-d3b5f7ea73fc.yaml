      ground at various angles relative to flight path throughout the collection
  examples: []
  id: '968'
  notes:
  - content: Steering the antenna also allows dwell time to be increased and provides
      the ability to collect strips at angles non-parallel to the flight direction
      and with better resolution than Stripmap mode.
