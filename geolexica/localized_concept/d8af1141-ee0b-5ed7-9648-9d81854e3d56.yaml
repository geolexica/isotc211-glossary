  notes:
  - content: Rights can be by law (copyright), by agreement, or by contract [the licence
      agreement]. In the case of digital commerce, DRM ensures that licences are adhered
      to, and that rights holders are compensated as appropriate for each transaction.
      Agents of the original rights holder can also issue licences, but their ability
      is only under the agency contract to the original principal.
