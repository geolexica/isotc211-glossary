  definition:
  - content: fraction of the total radiant energy that is received from the main beam,
      which is defined as the ratio of the power received within the "main lobe" to
      that of the total power received by the antenna
  examples: []

  notes:
  - content: |-
      stem:[eta_"M"] is calculated using the following formula: stem:[eta_("M") = frac(int int_(Y) F_(n) (theta ,  phi) d Omega)(int int_(4 pi) F_(n) (theta ,  phi) d Omega)]

      where

      stem:[F_n] is the antenna pattern;
      stem:[theta] is the elevation angle;
      stem:[phi] is the azimuth angle;
      stem:[d Omega] is the differential solid angle;
      stem:[Y] is the main lobe value.
  - content: Main beam is also referred as main lobe.
