  definition:
  - content: largest number n such that each direct position in a geometric set can
      be associated with a subset that has the direct position in its interior and
      is similar (isomorphic) to Rn, Euclidean n-space
  examples: []

  notes:
  - content: Curves, because they are continuous images of a portion of the real line,
      have geometric dimension 1. Surfaces cannot be mapped to stem:["R"^2] in their
      entirety, but around each point position, a small neighbourhood can be found
      that resembles (under continuous functions) the interior of the unit circle
      in stem:["R"^2], and are therefore 2-dimensional. In this International Standard,
      most surface patches (instances of GM_SurfacePatch) are mapped to portions of
      stem:["R"^2] by their defining interpolation mechanisms.
