  notes:
  - content: Measurements acquired in the field are affected by many instrumental
      and environmental factors, including meteorological conditions, computational
      methods and constraints, imperfect instrument construction, incomplete instrument
      adjustment or calibration, and, in the case of optical measuring systems, the
      personal bias of the observer.  Solutions for positions may be affected by the
      geometric relationships of the observed data and/or mathematical model employed
      in the processing software.
