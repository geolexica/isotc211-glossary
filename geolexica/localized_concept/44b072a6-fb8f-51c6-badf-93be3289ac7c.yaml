  notes:
  - content: A measure "d" is positive if d(x, y) > 0 for every x, y where x/=y and
      d(x,x) = 0. A measure "d" is symmetric if d(x, y) = d(y, x)  for every x, y.
      A measure "d" satisfies the triangular inequality if d(x, y) <= d(x, a) + d(a,
      y) for every a, x and y. All numeric or vector valued attributes have such a
      metric, the most common being the Euclidean metric based on the square root
      of the sum of the squares of the differences in each dimension. Other non-Euclidean
      metrics take "curvature of space" into account (such as along the surface of
      the spheroid).
