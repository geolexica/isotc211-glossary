  definition:
  - content: geometric object representing a single, connected, homogeneous (isotropic)
      element of space
  examples: []
  id: '2164'
  notes:
  - content: Geometric primitives are non-decomposed objects that present information
      about geometric configuration. They include points, curves, surfaces, and solids.
      Many geometric objects behave like primitives (supporting the same interfaces
      defined for geometric primitives) but are actually composites composed of some
      number of other primitives. General collections may be aggregates and incapable
      of acting like a primitive (such as the lines of a complex network, which is
      not connected and thus incapable of being traceable as a single line). By this
      definition, a geometric primitive is topological open, since the boundary points
      are not isotropic to the interior points. Geometry is assumed to be closed.
      For points, the boundary is empty.
