  definition:
  - content: largest element smaller than or equal to all elements of a set contained
      in an ordered domain (stem:[<=])
  examples: []
  id: '2072'
  notes:
  - content: stem:[[AA a in A => min(A) <= a] => [AA b notin [(b notin [AA a in A
      => b <= a] => [min(A) >= b]]]]] Any number is a lower bound of stem:[O/] considered
      as a set of numbers, because any given number is less than any number in stem:[O/]
      (an admitted vacuous statement since there is no number in stem:[O/], but true
      nonetheless). This means that the stem:[min(O/)] must be greater than any number;
      this stem:[+oo].
