  definition:
  - content: measure of the pairs of values of an attribute type that assigns a numeric
      value that is positive, symmetric and satisfies the triangular inequality
  examples: []
  id: '664'
  notes:
  - content: A measure "stem:[d]" is positive if stem:[d(x, y) > 0] for every stem:[x,
      y] where stem:[x ne y] and stem:[d(x,x) = 0]. A measure "stem:[d]" is symmetric
      if stem:[d(x, y) = d(y, x)]  for every stem:[x, y]. A measure "stem:[d]" satisfies
      the triangular inequality if stem:[d(x, y) <= d(x, a) + d(a, y)] for every stem:[a],
      stem:[x] and stem:[y]. All numeric or vector valued attributes have such a metric,
      the most common being the Euclidean metric based on the square root of the sum
      of the squares of the differences in each dimension. Other non-Euclidean metrics
      take "curvature of space" into account (such as along the surface of the spheroid).
