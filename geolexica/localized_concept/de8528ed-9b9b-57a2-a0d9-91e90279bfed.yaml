  definition:
  - content: point in a stem:[n]-dimension coordinate system using stem:[n+1] numbers,
      latexmath:[([u_0, u_1, u_2, u_3, ... , u_n] \backepsilon [[0 \leq u_i \leq 1]
      \wedge \sum u_i = 1.0])], in which the location of a point of an n-simplex (of
      any dimension) is specified by a weighted center of mass of equal masses placed
      at its vertices using vector algebra of the stem:[RR^n] used in the coordinate
      reference system

  notes:
  - content: Even though there are stem:[n+1] coordinates in a barycentric coordinate
      system, the topological dimension is stem:[n], since the restriction (sums to
      1.0) loses 1 degree of freedom (once you have stem:[n] ordinates, the remaining
      one is determined such as stem:[u_n = 1.0 âˆ’ sum_(i=0)^(n-1) u_i]. he coordinates
      for the simplex are all non-negative, but the system can be extended outside
      of the simples by using negative numbers. If the ordinates are all positive,
      then the point is inside (interior to) the stem:[n]-simplex. If one of them
      is 1.0 and the other 0, this is a corner of the simplex. If one of them is zero
      and the others still each greater than or equal to zero, the point is on the
      stem:[n-1]-simplex opposite the vertex zeroed out. If any are negative, the
      point is outside of the simplex. The coordinates are dependent on the underlying
      coordinate reference system of the source data.
