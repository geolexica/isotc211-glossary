  definition:
  - content: property of a geometric object that its interior is isotropic (all points
      have isomorphic neighbourhoods), and hence everywhere locally isomorphic to
      an open subset of a Euclidean coordinate space of the appropriate dimension
  examples: []
  id: '411'
  notes:
  - content: This implies that no interior direct position is involved in a self-intersection
      of any kind.
