  notes:
  - content: 'The term "grid" originates historically from a 2D view: in ISO 19123
      a grid consists of a network composed of one or more sets of curves in which
      the members of each set intersect the members of the other sets. Meantime, nD
      grids (including 1D) are known and in use. The "covering" of a region is also
      known as a "tessellation" in mathematics.'
  - content: The ISO 19123 definition is equivalent to the revised definition of this
      document.
