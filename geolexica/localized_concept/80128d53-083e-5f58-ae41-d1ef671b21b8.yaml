  id: '2158'
  notes:
  - content: Sets are equal if they contain exactly the same elements. Since any two
      empty sets would share exactly the same contained elements (by definition none),
      they are, by definition, equal. The empty set (stem:[O/]) can be considered
      a geometric entity, because all the elements it contains are points. This is
      a vacuous statement since the set stem:[O/] contains no elements, and therefore
      the "for all" statement has nothing to test and is thus true in each of its
      non-existent cases. There are a lot of true but vacuous statements in proofs
      about stem:[O/]. This confuses some programmers since many systems use type
      safe sets, in which the class of the entities determines a class for the container
      set. The math does not care about "class" and only sees sets; so that an empty
      set of aardvarks and an empty set of zebras in mathematics are (is?) the same
      set. The other confusion is that stem:[O/] is not the database Null introduced
      by Codd and used in relational and other query languages in 3 valued logic.
      Null means unknown and many statements involving Null are undecidable (neither
      provably true nor provably false). The empty set is not "lack of knowledge"
      but certainty in the nonexistence of elements in the set. Most statements beginning
      "for all elements in stem:[O/]" are true, but vacuous. Most statements beginning
      "there exist an element in stem:[O/]" are always categorically false. It is
      almost impossible to construct an undecidable statement about stem:[O/]. Null
      and stem:[O/] are not related. "Void" can mean "invalid" or "completely empty."
