  notes:
  - content: Some projections are conformal. For example, a Mercator preserves the
      angle between curves, so that if two curves in a Mercator projected plane cross
      at a 90°, then the preimage curves on the ellipsoid also cross at 90°, such
      as lines of constant latitude and lines of constant longitude.
