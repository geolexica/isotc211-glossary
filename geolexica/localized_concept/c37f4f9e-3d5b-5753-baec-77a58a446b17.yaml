  - content: matrix characterizing the scattering process at the target of interest
      for polarimetric SAR
  examples: []
  id: '2201'
  notes:
  - content: Scattering matrix is defined via stem:[((E_H^s),(E_V^s)) = e^(jkR)/R
      ([S_(HH),S_(HV)], [S_(VH), S_(VV)])((E_H^j), (E_V^j))] where stem:[([S_(HH),S_(HV)],
      [S_(VH), S_(VV)])] is the scattering matrix; stem:[((E_H^j), (E_V^j))] is the
      electronic field vector of the wave incident on the scatterer; stem:[((E_H^s),
      (E_V^s))] is the electronic field vector of the scattered wave; stem:[k] is
      the wavenumber of the illuminating wave; stem:[R] is the distance between the
      target and the radar antenna.
