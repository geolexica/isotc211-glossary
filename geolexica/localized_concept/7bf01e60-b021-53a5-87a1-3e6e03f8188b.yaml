  notes:
  - content: 'Product levels 0 through 4 indicate the degree of processing performed
      on the raw data to convert them into more useful parameters and formats. The
      Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) defines product levels as follows:
      - Raw Data: Data in their original packets, as received from a satellite. -
      Level 0: Reconstructed unprocessed instrument data at full space time resolution
      with all available supplemental information to be used in subsequent processing
      (e.g. ephemeris, health and safety) appended. - Level 1: Unpacked, reformatted
      level 0 data, with all supplemental information to be used in subsequent processing
      appended. Optional radiometric and geometric correction applied to produce parameters
      in physical units. Data generally presented as full - Level 2: Retrieved environmental
      variables (e.g. ocean wave height, soil moisture, ice concentration) at the
      same resolution and location as the level 1 source data. - Level 3: Data or
      retrieved environmental variables which have been spatially and/or temporally
      re-sampled (i.e. derived from level 1 or 2 products). Such re-sampling may include
      averaging and compositing. - Level 4: Model output or results from analyses
      of lower level data (i.e. variables that are not directly measured by the instruments
      but are derived from these measurements).'
  - content: The product levels defined here are derived from satellite remote sensing
      heritage. For the case of airborne and in situ observations, these do not necessarily
      apply, but may be used as appropriate for indicating the degree of processing
      performed on the observed data.
