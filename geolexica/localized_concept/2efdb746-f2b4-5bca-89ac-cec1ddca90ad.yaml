      This is often estimated by using the ideal equation for a total-power radiometer, as shown in the following formula. stem:[DeltaT_("min")=(T_("sys"))/(sqrt(Btau))]

      where

      stem:[DeltaT_("min")] is the radiometric resolution;
      stem:[T_("sys")] is the radiometer system temperature;
      stem:[B] is the bandwidth of the radiometer system
      stem:[tau] is the integral time.

      Radiometric resolution can be also estimated from the variant of this equation that is appropriate for the particular radiometer in question.
