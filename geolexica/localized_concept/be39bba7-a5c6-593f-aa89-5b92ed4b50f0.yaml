  - content: |-
      This is also equivalent to the ratio of the antenna radiation resistance (stem:[R_"rad"]) divided by the sum of the antenna radiation resistance and the antenna Ohmic resistance (stem:[R_Omega]), as described in the following formula: stem:[eta_"l"=(P_"rad")/(P_"in")=(R_"rad")/(R_"rad"+R_Omega)]

      where

      stem:[P_"rad"] is the total radiated power;
      stem:[P_"in"] is the total power accepted by the antenna;
      stem:[R_"rad"] is the antenna radiation resistance;
      stem:[R_Omega] is the antenna Ohmic resistance.
  - content: Antenna radiation efficiency (stem:[eta_"l"] ) is also called as Ohmic
      efficiency (stem:[eta_Omega]).
