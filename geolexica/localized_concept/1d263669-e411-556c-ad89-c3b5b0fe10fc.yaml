  - content: common URI prefix or stem used in identifiers for a set of related resources
  examples: []
  id: '1589'
  notes:
  - content: The RDF namespace is concatenated with the localName to create the complete
      URI identifier for an RDF resource. Every RDF resource is identified by a URI.
      In contrast, an XML namespace URI scopes a local XML component name, but there
      is no rule for combining these into a single identifier string.
