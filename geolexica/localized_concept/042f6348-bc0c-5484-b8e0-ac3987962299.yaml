  - content: geometry or topology function using a cell's zonal identifiers to specify
      geometry
  examples: []
  id: '2568'
  notes:
  - content: ISO 19107 specifies a suite of geometry and topology functions in the
      Query2D and Query3D classes, where geometry elements used in each function's
      parameters are described by sets of coordinates. In DGGS all geometry can be
      referenced as sets of cells (3.2) represented solely by a list (or set) of their
      zonal identifiers. This document specifies ZoneQuery to implement the operations
      in both Query2D and Query3D using zonal identifiers to reference each operation's
      source and target geometry.
