  definition:
  - content: ratio between the peak power of the largest side lobe and the peak power
      of the main lobe of the impulse response of point targets in the SAR image
  examples: []
  id: '2286'
  notes:
  - content: The peak side lobe ratio is usually expressed in decibels (dB) and computed
      as follows stem:["PSLR" = 10log_(10) {(P_("sidepeak"))/(P_("mainpeak"))}] where
      stem:[P_"mainpeak"] is the peak power of the main lobe; P_"sidepeak" is the
      peak power of the largest side lobe.
