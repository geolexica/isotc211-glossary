  definition:
  - content: samling av icke överlappande geometriska grundelement där avgränsningen
      hos varje geometriskt grundelement kan representeras av unionen av andra geometriska
      grundelement av lägre geometrisk dimension som finns i samma samling
  examples: []
  id: '212'
  notes:
  - content: The geometric primitives in the set are disjoint in the sense that no
      direct position is interior to more than one geometric primitive. The set is
      closed under boundary operations, meaning that for each element in the geometric
      complex, there is a collection (also a geometric complex) of geometric primitives
      that represents the boundary of that element. Recall that the boundary of a
      point (the only 0D primitive object type in geometry) is empty. Thus, if the
      largest dimension geometric primitive is a solid (3D), the composition of the
      boundary operator in this definition terminates after at most three steps. It
      is also the case that the boundary of any object is a cycle.
