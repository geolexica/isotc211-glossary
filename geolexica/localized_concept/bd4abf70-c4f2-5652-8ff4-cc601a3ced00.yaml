  definition:
  - content: measure of the capability of the object to scatter the transmitted radar
      power
  examples: []
  id: '2200'
  notes:
  - content: Radar cross section is calculated as stem:[sigma = lim_(R ->oo) 4 pi
      R^2 (abs(E_s)^2) / (abs(E_i)^2)] where stem:[sigma] is the radar cross section;
      stem:[E_i] is the electric-field strength of the incident wave; stem:[E_s] is
      the electric-field strength of the scattered wave at the radar with a distance
      stem:[R] away from the target.
  - content: 'Â 2 to entry: Radar cross section has the dimensions of area, with the
      unit of square metres. Usually, it is expressed in the form of a logarithm with
      the unit of dBsm as follows stem:[sigma_"dBsm" = 10 log_(10) sigma]'
