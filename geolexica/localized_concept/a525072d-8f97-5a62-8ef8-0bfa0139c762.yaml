      of the dish and does not contribute to the main beam

  notes:
  - content: |-
      Spillover factor is written as stem:[1−Lambda_”p”] and can be measured in the field, where stem:[Lambda_”p”] is the ratio of antenna pattern within the Earth to all space of stem:[4pi]. stem:[Lambda_"p"=int_"Z" dOmega(F_(n,"PP")+F_(n,"PQ"))]

      where

      stem:[F_(n,"PP")] is the co-polarization antenna pattern;
      stem:[F_(n,"PQ")] is the cross-polarization antenna pattern;
      stem:[dOmega] is the differential solid angle;
      stem:[Z] is the Earth.
