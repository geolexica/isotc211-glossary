  - content: For PolSAR sensor, if the transmitting channel is horizontally (H) polarized,
      the cross-talk on transmitting defines the ratio of V polarization transmitting
      power to H polarization transmitting power, expressed in decibels (dB). The
      cross-talk on receiving is similar to that on transmitting.
