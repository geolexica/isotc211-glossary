  definition:
  - content: information that maps a data object into more meaningful concepts
  examples:
  - content: Representation information for a bit sequence which is a FITS file might
      consist of the FITS standard which defines the format plus a dictionary which
      defines the meaning in the file of keywords which are not part of the standard.
  - content: JPEG software which is used to render a JPEG file; rendering the JPEG
      file as bits is not very meaningful to humans but the software, which embodies
      an understanding of the JPEG standard, maps the bits into pixels which can then
      be rendered as an image for human viewing.
