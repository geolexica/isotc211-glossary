  notes:
  - content: 'If the radar return from the illuminated area is contributed by a number
      of independent scattering elements, it is described by the backscattering coefficient
      instead of radar cross section used for the point target. It is calculated as
      stem:[sigma^0 = sigma/A] where stem:[sigma] is the total radar cross section
      of an area stem:[A]. stem:[sigma^0] is a dimesionless parameter and is usually
      expressed in decibels (dB) as follows: stem:[sigma_"dB"^0 = 10 log_(10) sigma^0]'
  - content: "“Backscattering coefficient” is sometimes called “normalized radar cross
      section”."
