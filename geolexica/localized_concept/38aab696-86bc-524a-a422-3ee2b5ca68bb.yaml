  definition:
  - content: minimum number of free variables needed to distinguish nearby direct
      positions within a geometric object from one another
  examples: []
  id: '463'
  notes:
  - content: The free variables mentioned above can usually be thought of as a local
      coordinate system. In a 3D coordinate space, a plane can be written as stem:[P(u,
      v) = A + u X + v Y], where stem:[u] and stem:[v] are real numbers and stem:[A]
      is any point on the plane, and stem:[X] and stem:[Y] are two vectors tangent
      to the plane. Since the locations on the plane can be distinguished by stem:[u]
      and stem:[v] (here universally), the plane is 2D and stem:[(u, v)] is a coordinate
      system for the points on the plane. On generic surfaces, this cannot, in general,
      be done universally. If we take a plane tangent to the surface, and project
      points on the surface onto this plane, we will normally get a local  isomorphism
      for small neighbourhoods of the point of tangency. This "local coordinate" system
      for the underlying surface is sufficient to establish the surface as a 2D topological
      object. Since this International Standard deals only with spatial coordinates,
      any 3D object can rely on coordinates to establish its topological dimension.
      In a 4D model (spatio-temporal), tangent spaces also play an important role
      in establishing topological dimension for objects up to 3D.
