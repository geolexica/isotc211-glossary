  - content: number of separate decisions needed to describe a position in a coordinate
      system

  id: '2039'
  notes:
  - content: The coordinate dimension represents the number of choices made, and constraints
      can restrict choices. A barycentric coordinate which has stem:[(n+1)]-offsets,
      but the underlying space is dimension stem:[n]. Homogeneous coordinates stem:[(wx,
      wy, wz, w)] are actually 3 dimensional because the choice of "stem:[w]" does
      not affect the position, i.e. stem:[(wx, wy, wz, w) = (x y, z, 1) -> (x, y,
      z)] which is not affected by stem:[w]. The dimension will be at most the count
      of the numbers in the coordinate, but it can be less if the coordinates are
      constrained in some manner.
