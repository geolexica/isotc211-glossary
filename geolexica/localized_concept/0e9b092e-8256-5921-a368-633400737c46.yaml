  definition:
  - content: convex hull of n+1 points in general position in a space of dimension
      at least n, or a topologically isomorphic image of such a geometry
  examples: []
  id: '2075'
  notes:
  - content: An n-simplex is stem:[n]-dimensional, and is topological isomorphic to
      an stem:[n]-disc. A 0-simplex is a point. A 1-simplex is a curve (usually a
      line) with two 0-simplexes (points) on its boundary; a 2-simplex is a triangular
      surface with three 1-simplices on its boundary. In general, an stem:[n]-simplex
      boundary will have stem:[n (n−1)]-simplexes. An stem:[n]-simplex and an stem:[n]-disc
      are topologically isomorphic. The boundary of an stem:[n]-simplex is isomorphic
      to an stem:[(n−1)]-sphere. In all cases, the number prefix represents the topological
      dimension of the object.
