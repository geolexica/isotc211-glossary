  notes:
  - content: A single area is the norm and multiple areas are the exception.
  - content: Spatial units are structured in a way to support the creation and management
      of basic administrative units.
  - content: This International Standard [ISO 19152:2012] supports either 2-dimensional
      (2D), 3-dimensional (3D), or mixed (2D and 3D) representations of spatial units,
      which may be described in text (“from this tree to that river”), or based on
      a single point, or represented as a set of unstructured lines, or as a surface,
      or as a 3D volume.
  - content: In addition to spatial units represented by a single point, text, or
      a set of unstructured lines, a spatial unit may have an area equal to zero for
      administrative reasons.
