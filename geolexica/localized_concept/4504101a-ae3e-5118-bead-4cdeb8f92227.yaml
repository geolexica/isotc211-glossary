      usually uses axis names ''stem:[x]'', ''stem:[y]'', and ''stem:[z]'', Its first
      spatial dimension is ''stem:[x]'', its second is ''stem:[y]'' and its third
      is ''stem:[z]''." In the context of the space, the adjective use describes the
      space but the singular noun can use a name for an axis separately.'
