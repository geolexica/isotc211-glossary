  definition:
  - content: linear feature that describes a change in the smoothness or continuity
      of a surface
  examples: []
  id: '1932'
  notes:
  - content: A soft breakline ensures that known z-values along a linear feature are
      maintained (for example, elevations along a pipeline, road centreline or drainage
      ditch), and ensures that linear features and polygon edges are maintained in
      a Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN) surface model, by enforcing the breaklines
      as TIN edges. They are generally synonymous with 3-D breaklines because they
      are depicted with series of x/y/z coordinates. Somewhat rounded ridges or the
      trough of a drain may be collected using soft breaklines.
  - content: A hard breakline defines interruptions in surface smoothness, for example,
      to define streams, shorelines, dams, ridges, building footprints, and other
      locations with abrupt surface changes.
