  - content: set of points
  examples: []
  id: '2166'
  notes:
  - content: This set in most cases is infinite, except where the set consists of
      a list of point locations. Curves, surfaces and volumes being continuous are
      infinite sets of points. Some systems will define 'degenerate' curves, which
      are actually points.
