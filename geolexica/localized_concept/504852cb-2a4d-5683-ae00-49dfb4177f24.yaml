  notes:
  - content: The term comes from the most commonly known algorithm for finding a shortest
      path in a positively weighted graph, from E. Dijkstra's paper [7]. Although
      this algorithm is not the only one in use, the requirements for the graph are
      common to most. The most common relaxation of the requirement is the "positive
      weights," which are not needed in the Bellman-Ford algorithm [4], [8].
