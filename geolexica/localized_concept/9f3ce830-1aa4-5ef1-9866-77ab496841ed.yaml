  definition:
  - content: second derivative of a curve parameterized by arc length, at a point
  examples: []
  id: '2041'
  notes:
  - content: If stem:[c(s) = (x(s), y(s), z(s))] is a curve in a 3D Cartesian space
      (stem:[bbb"E"^3]), and stem:[s] is the arc length along stem:[c(s)], then the
      unit tangent vector is stem:[dot c(s) = (dot x(s), dot y(s), dot z(s))], i.e.
      the derivative of the coordinate values of stem:[c] with respect to stem:[s].
      The curvature vector is stem:[ddot c(s) = (ddot x(s), ddot y(s), ddot z(s))].
      The curvature vector can be approximated by the inverse of the radius of a circle
      through any 3 nearby points on the curve (pointed from the curve to towards
      the centre of the circle)
