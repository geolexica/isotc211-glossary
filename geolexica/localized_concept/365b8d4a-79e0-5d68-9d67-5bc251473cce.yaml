  definition:
  - content: ratio between the side lobe power and the main lobe power of the impulse
      response of point targets in the radar imaging scene
  examples: []
  id: '2285'
  notes:
  - content: The integrated side lobe ratio (ISLR) can be obtained by integrating
      the power of the impulse response over suitable regions. The ISLR is expressed
      as  stem:["ISLR" = 10log_(10) {(P_("total")-P_("main"))/(P_("main"))}] where  stem:[P_("total")]
      is the total power, stem:[P_("main")] is the main lobe power.
  - content: The main lobe width can be taken as α times the impulse response width
      (IRW), centred around the peak, where α is a predefined constant, usually between
      2 and 2,5.
