  notes:
  - content: A dataset may be a smaller grouping of data which, though limited by
      some constraint such as spatial extent or feature type, is located physically
      within a larger dataset. Theoretically, a dataset may be as small as a single
      feature or feature attribute contained within a larger dataset. A hardcopy map
      or chart may be considered a dataset.
