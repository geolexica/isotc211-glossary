  definition:
  - content: closeness of agreement between indications or measured quantity values
      obtained by replicate measurements on the same or similar objects under specified
      conditions
  examples: []
  id: '1465'
  notes:
  - content: Measurement precision is usually expressed numerically by measures of
      imprecision, such as standard deviation, variance, or coefficient of variation
      under the specified conditions of measurement.
  - content: The "specified conditions" can be, for example, repeatability conditions
      of measurement, intermediate precision conditions of measurement, or reproducibility
      conditions of measurement (see ISO 5725-3).
  - content: Measurement precision is used to define measurement repeatability, intermediate
      measurement precision, and measurement reproducibility.
  - content: Sometimes "measurement precision" is erroneously used to mean measurement
      accuracy.
