          notes:
          - Curves, because they are continuous images of a portion of the real line,
            have geometric dimension 1. Surfaces cannot always be mapped to `RR^2`
            in their entirety, but around each point position, a small neighborhood
            can be found that resembles (under continuous functions) the interior
            of the unit circle in `RR^2`, and are therefore 2-dimensional. In this
            document, most surfaces (instances of Surface) are mapped to portions
            of `RR^2` by their defining interpolation mechanisms.
