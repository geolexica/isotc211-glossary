          notes:
          - A geodesic's curvature vector is perpendicular the surface thus has the
            minimum curvature of any curve restricted to the surface. This is often
            defined as a minimal distance curve between two points, but this does
            not always suffice, since some points (especially on ellipsoids and spheres)
            are often joined by more than one geodesic. For example, on an ellipsoid
            the points with (φ, λ) = (0, 0) and (0, 180) are joined by four separate
            geodesic [2 polar (the shorter) and 2 equatorial]. The exponential map
            is only guaranteed to be one-to-one for a small area (depending on where
            the centre is and how the surface is curved).
