            The proofs of the Pythagorean metrics all depend on the local "flatness"
            of the space. Cartesian coordinate space which have Pythagorean metrics
            are called Euclidean spaces (`bbb"E"^n`). In the realm of coordinate reference
            systems, only "Engineering Coordinate Systems" are Euclidean. Any CRS
            using a curved Datum are by definition non-Euclidean, and cannot "truthfully"
            use Pythagorean metrics except for approximation. These approximations
            are valid for topological statements, but not for real world measures
            without adjustments.'
