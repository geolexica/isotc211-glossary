          - Cycles are used to describe boundary components. A cycle usually has no
            boundary because it closes on itself, but it is bounded (i.e., it does
            not have infinite extent). A circle or a sphere, for example, has no boundary
            (i.e., its boundary is empty), but is bounded.
