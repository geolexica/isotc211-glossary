          definition: property of a geometric object that its interior is isotropic
            (all points have isomorphic neighbourhoods), and hence everywhere locally
            isomorphic to an open subset of a Euclidean coordinate space of the appropriate
            dimension

          notes:
          - This implies that no interior direct position is involved in a self-intersection
            of any kind.
