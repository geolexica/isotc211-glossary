          definition: constituent part of a postal address
          entry_status: valid
          examples:

          id: 2119
          language_code: eng
          notes:
          - The components of postal addresses are defined in 6.2, 6.3 and 6.4.
          - A postal address component may be, but is not limited to, an element,
            a construct or a segment.
          - For convenience, the preferred term “postal address component” has been
            shortened to the admitted term “component” throughout this document.
