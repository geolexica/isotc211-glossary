          notes:
          - An OAIS Archive meets a set of responsibilities that allows to be distinguished
            from other uses of the term 'archive'. The term 'open' in OAIS is used
            to imply that this recommendation and future related recommendations and
            standards are developed in open forums, and it does not imply that access
            to the archive is unrestricted.
