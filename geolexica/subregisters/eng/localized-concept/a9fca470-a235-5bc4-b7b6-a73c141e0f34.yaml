          definition: coordinate operation that changes coordinates in a source coordinate
            reference system to coordinates in a target coordinate reference system
            in which the source and target coordinate reference systems are based
            on different datums

          notes:
          - A coordinate transformation uses parameters which are derived empirically.
            Any error in those coordinates will be embedded in the coordinate transformation
            and when the coordinate transformation is applied the embedded errors
            are transmitted to output coordinates.
          - A coordinate transformation is colloquially sometimes referred to as a
            'datum transformation'. This is erroneous. A coordinate transformation
            changes coordinate values. It does not change the definition of the datum.
            In this document coordinates are referenced to a coordinate reference
            system. A coordinate transformation operates between two coordinate reference
            systems, not between two datums.
