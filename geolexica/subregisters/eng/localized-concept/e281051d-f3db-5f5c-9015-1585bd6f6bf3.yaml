          notes:
          - This refers to, amongst others, orthometric height and Normal height,
            which are both approximations of the distance of a point above the mean
            sea level, but also may include Normal-orthometric heights, dynamic heights
            or geopotential numbers.
          - The distance from the reference surface may follow a curved line, not
            necessarily straight, as it is influenced by the direction of gravity.
