          - May follow a pre-defined trip pattern or the trip may be ad hoc according
            to specific mobility demands. Depending on the nature of the trip, it
            may start and stop at several transfer nodes.
          - A trip may serve many travellers, and the travellers may make use different
            part of a trip (e.g. different legs between different bus stops), and
            these parts may be whole journeys or journey segments.
