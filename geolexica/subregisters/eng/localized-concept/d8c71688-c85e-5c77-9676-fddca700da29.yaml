          definition: coverage that returns different values for the same feature
            attribute at different direct positions within a single spatial object,
            temporal object, or spatiotemporal object in its domain

          notes:
          - Although the domain of a continuous coverage is ordinarily bounded in
            terms of its spatial and/or temporal extent, it can be subdivided into
            an infinite number of direct positions.
