          - Due to legal aspects, history of data, inaccurate geometries or missing
            geometries, geospatial overlay techniques may generate invalid, or no
            relationships between spatial units, which can be introduced by required
            relationships.
          - Relationships for spatial units may be defined with ISO 19125-2 types.
