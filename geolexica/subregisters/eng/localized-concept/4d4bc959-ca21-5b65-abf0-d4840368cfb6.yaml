          notes:
          - The universal face is normally not part of any feature, and is used to
            represent the unbounded portion of the data set. Its interior boundary
            (it has no exterior boundary) would normally be considered the exterior
            boundary of the map represented by the data set. This International Standard
            does not special case the universal face, but application schemas may
            find it convenient to do so.
