          notes:
          - A class or data element definition instantiates a type if it creates the
            ability to create objects or data elements respectively, that can represent
            the concepts (instance data and /or operations) defined by that type.
            A class is instantiated by an object if the class defines that object's
            structure and function. A data schema is instantiated by a data element
            if the data schema defines that element's structure.
