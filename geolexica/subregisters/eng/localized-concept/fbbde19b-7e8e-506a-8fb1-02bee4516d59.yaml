          notes:
          - A homomorphism is distinct from a isomorphism in that no inverse function
            is required. In an isomorphism, there are two homomorphisms that are functional
            inverses of one another. Continuous functions are topological homomorphisms
            because they preserve "topological characteristics". The mapping of topological
            complexes to their geometric realizations preserves the concept of boundary
            and is therefore a homomorphism.
