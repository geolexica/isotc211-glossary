          notes:
          - A single area is the norm and multiple areas are the exception.
          - Spatial units are structured in a way to support the creation and management
            of basic administrative units.
          - This International Standard [ISO 19152:2012] supports either 2-dimensional
            (2D), 3-dimensional (3D), or mixed (2D and 3D) representations of spatial
            units, which may be described in text (“from this tree to that river”),
            or based on a single point, or represented as a set of unstructured lines,
            or as a surface, or as a 3D volume.
          - In addition to spatial units represented by a single point, text, or a
            set of unstructured lines, a spatial unit may have an area equal to zero
            for administrative reasons.
