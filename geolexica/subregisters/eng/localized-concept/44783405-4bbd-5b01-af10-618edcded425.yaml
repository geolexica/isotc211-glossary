          notes:
          - The tangent is usually calculated by differentiation of a functional representation
            of a curve but it may be approximated by a secant (double intersection)
            line from the point passing through another nearby point on the curve.
            The closer the second point is to the first, the better the approximation
            of the tangent's direction.
