          definition: linear feature that describes a change in the smoothness or
            continuity of a surface

          notes:
          - A soft breakline ensures that known z-values along a linear feature are
            maintained (for example, elevations along a pipeline, road centreline
            or drainage ditch), and ensures that linear features and polygon edges
            are maintained in a Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN) surface model,
            by enforcing the breaklines as TIN edges. They are generally synonymous
            with 3-D breaklines because they are depicted with series of x/y/z coordinates.
            Somewhat rounded ridges or the trough of a drain may be collected using
            soft breaklines.
          - A hard breakline defines interruptions in surface smoothness, for example,
            to define streams, shorelines, dams, ridges, building footprints, and
            other locations with abrupt surface changes.
