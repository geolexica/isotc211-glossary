          notes:
          - The interior is everywhere locally isomorphic to an open disc in a Euclidean
            coordinate space of the appropriate dimension `D^n = {P | norm P < 1.0}`.
            The boundary is a dimension one smaller. This essentially means that the
            object does not intersect nor touch itself. Generally used for a curve
            that does not cross not touch itself with the possible exception of boundary
            points. Simple closed curves are isomorphic to a circle.
