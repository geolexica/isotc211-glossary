          notes:
          - The spectral responsivity is the response of the sensor with respect to
            the wavelengths dependent radiance.
          - The definition is described mathematically in IEC 60050-845. The spectral
            responsivity is quotient of the detector output dY(λ) by the monochromatic
            detector input dXe(λ) = Xe, λ(λ) • dλ in the wavelength interval dλ as
            a function of the wavelength λ  s(λ) = dY(λ) / dXc(λ)
