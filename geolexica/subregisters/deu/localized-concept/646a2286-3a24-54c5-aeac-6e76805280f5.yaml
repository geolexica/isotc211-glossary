          notes:
          - A passive object is usually accessed through an external interface, through
            which it receives requests, processes those requests and returns data
            as a response to that request. Since objects can implement more than one
            type, it is possible for a single object to pass through active and passive
            states. For example, a tracking service can lie dormant until a tracking
            request activates a period where the internals of the object initiate
            tracking activities based on internal triggers as specified within the
            request. When the tracking request is deactivated, the object may return
            to a passive state.
