          - The term comes from the most commonly known algorithm for finding a shortest
            path in a positively weighted graph, from E. Dijkstra's paper [7]. Although
            this algorithm is not the only one in use, the requirements for the graph
            are common to most. The most common relaxation of the requirement is the
            "positive weights," which are not needed in the Bellman-Ford algorithm
            [4], [8].
