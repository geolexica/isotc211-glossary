          - Performance indicators can be used as quality-control evidence of the
            positioning system and/or positioning solution. Internal quality control
            may include such factors as signal strength of received radio signals
            [signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)], figures indicating the dilution of precision
            (DOP) due to geometric constraints in radiolocation systems, and system-specific
            figure of merit (FOM).
