          - Geocoding usually refers to the translation of "address" or "intersection"
            to "direct position." Many services providers also include a "reverse
            geocoding" interface to their geocoder, thus extending the definition
            of the service as a general translator of location. Because routing services
            use internal location encodings not usually available to others, a geocoder
            is an integral part of the internals of such a service.
