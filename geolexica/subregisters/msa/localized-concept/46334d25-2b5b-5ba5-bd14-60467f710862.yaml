          notes:
          - The rotor spins on a fixed axis while the structure around it rotates
            or tilts. In airplanes, the pitch and orientation of the airplane is measured
            against the steady spin of the gyroscope. In space, where the four compass
            points are meaningless, the gyroscope's axis of rotation is used as a
            reference point for navigation. An inertial navigation system includes
            three gimbal-mounted gyroscopes, used to measure roll, pitch, and yaw.
