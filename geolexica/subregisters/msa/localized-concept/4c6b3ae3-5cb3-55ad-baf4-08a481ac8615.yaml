          notes:
          - The concept of "measurement error" can be used both a) when there is a
            single reference quantity value to refer to, which occurs if a calibration
            is made by means of a measurement standard with a measured quantity value
            having a negligible measurement uncertainty or if a conventional quantity
            value is given, in which case the measurement error is known, and b) if
            a measurand is supposed to be represented by a unique true quantity value
            or a set of true quantity values of negligible range, in which case the
            measurement error is not known.
          - Measurement error should not be confused with production error or mistake.
