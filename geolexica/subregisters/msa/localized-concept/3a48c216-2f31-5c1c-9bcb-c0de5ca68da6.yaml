          - “Recreation area” is a land use term that can be applicable to different
            land cover types, e.g. sandy surfaces such as a beach; a built-up area
            such as a pleasure park; woodlands etc.

          notes:
          - The definition of land use in this way establishes a direct link between
            land cover and the actions of people in their environment. Multiple land
            uses can coexist at the same location (e.g. forestry and recreation),
            contrary to land cover classes that are mutually exclusive.
