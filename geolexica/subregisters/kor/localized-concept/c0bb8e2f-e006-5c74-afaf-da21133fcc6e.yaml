          notes:
          - Measurement precision is usually expressed numerically by measures of
            imprecision, such as standard deviation, variance, or coefficient of variation
            under the specified conditions of measurement.
          - The "specified conditions" can be, for example, repeatability conditions
            of measurement, intermediate precision conditions of measurement, or reproducibility
            conditions of measurement (see ISO 5725-3).
          - Measurement precision is used to define measurement repeatability, intermediate
            measurement precision, and measurement reproducibility.
          - Sometimes "measurement precision" is erroneously used to mean measurement
            accuracy.
