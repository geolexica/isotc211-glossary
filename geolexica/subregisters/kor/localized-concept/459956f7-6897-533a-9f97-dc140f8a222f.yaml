          notes:
          - These detectors exist in the form of arrays and are bonded with electronic
            circuitry.  The electronic circuitry produces a measurement corresponding
            to the time at which the current was generated; resulting in a direct
            time-of-flight measurement.  A LIDAR that employs this detector technology
            typically illuminates a large scene with a single pulse.  The direct time-of-flight
            measurements are then combined with platform location/attitude data along
            with pointing information to produce a three-dimensional product of the
            illuminated scene of interest. Additional processing is applied which
            removes existing noise present in the data to produce a visually exploitable
            data set.
