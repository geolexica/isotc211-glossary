  notes:
  - content: These detectors exist in the form of arrays and are bonded with electronic
      circuitry.  The electronic circuitry produces a measurement corresponding to
      the time at which the current was generated; resulting in a direct time-of-flight
      measurement.  A LIDAR that employs this detector technology typically illuminates
      a large scene with a single pulse.  The direct time-of-flight measurements are
      then combined with platform location/attitude data along with pointing information
      to produce a three-dimensional product of the illuminated scene of interest.  Additional
      processing is applied which removes existing noise present in the data to produce
      a visually exploitable data set.
