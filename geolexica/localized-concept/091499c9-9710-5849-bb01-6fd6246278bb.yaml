  - content: Payment providers can be telephone and cellular companies, banks, credit
      card corporations, ISPs, network operators, and utility companies. The payment
      provider bills the consumer, deducts a fee, and forwards the payment to the
      content provider. The payment provider is thus responsible for the balancing
      of accounts.
