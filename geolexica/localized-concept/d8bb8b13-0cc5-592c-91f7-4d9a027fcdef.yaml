          definition: part of a linear feature that is distinguished from the remainder
            of that feature by a subset of attributes, each having a single value

          notes:
          - A linear segment is a one-dimensional object without explicit geometry.
          - The implicit geometry of the linear segment can be derived from the geometry
            of the parent feature.
