          - In some legal traditions, “party” refers to person in a legal dispute,
            while “principal” can be the entity initiating a contract, such as an
            agency.

          notes:
          - These two terms [principal and party] are used as near synonyms from ORDL
            and ISO 21000. There will be no distinction between these two terms made
            here, but there can be distinctions in legal documents depending on local
            laws.
