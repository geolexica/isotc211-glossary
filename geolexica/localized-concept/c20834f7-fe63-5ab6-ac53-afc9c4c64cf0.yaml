  - content: test to find errors in the implementation
  examples: []
  id: '167'
  notes:
  - content: If errors are found, one can correctly deduce that the implementation
      does not conform to the International Standard; however, the absence of errors
      does not necessarily imply the converse.  The falsification test can only demonstrate
      non-conformance
