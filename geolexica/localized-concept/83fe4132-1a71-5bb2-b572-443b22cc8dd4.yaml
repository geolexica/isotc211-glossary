          - The geometric primitives in the set are disjoint in the sense that no
            direct position is interior to more than one geometric primitive. The
            set is closed under boundary operations, meaning that for each element
            in the geometric complex, there is a collection (also a geometric complex)
            of geometric primitives that represents the boundary of that element.
            Recall that the boundary of a point (the only 0D primitive object type
            in geometry) is empty. Thus, if the largest dimension geometric primitive
            is a solid (3D), the composition of the boundary operator in this definition
            terminates after at most three steps. It is also the case that the boundary
            of any object is a cycle.
