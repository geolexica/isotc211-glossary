  notes:
  - content: The interpolation of continuous change is usually done by taking into
      consideration constraints on the "curve" joining the two data points (time1,
      value1) and (time2, value2), looking at the value as a function of time. For
      example, if the continuous change is for the motion of a vehicle, then the constraints
      of physics and of the paths appropriate for that vehicle must be taken into
      consideration.
