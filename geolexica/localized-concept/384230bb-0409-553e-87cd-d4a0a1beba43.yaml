          definition: change in an attribute whose type has a distance measure such
            that its value can be assumed to take on intermediate values between two
            known measurements

          notes:
          - The interpolation of continuous change is usually done by taking into
            consideration constraints on the "curve" joining the two data points (time1,
            value1) and (time2, value2), looking at the value as a function of time.
            For example, if the continuous change is for the motion of a vehicle,
            then the constraints of physics and of the paths appropriate for that
            vehicle must be taken into consideration.
