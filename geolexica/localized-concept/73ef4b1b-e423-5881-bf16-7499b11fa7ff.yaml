  definition:
  - content: face that is used in the 3-dimensional representation of a boundary of
      a spatial unit
  examples: []
  id: '1359'
  notes:
  - content: Boundary faces are used when the implied vertical and unbounded faces
      of a boundary face string are not sufficient to describe 3D spatial units. Boundary
      faces close volumes in height (e.g. every apartment floor), or in depth (e.g.
      an underground parking garage), or in all other directions to form a bounded
      volume. The volumes represent legal space (in contrast with physical space).
