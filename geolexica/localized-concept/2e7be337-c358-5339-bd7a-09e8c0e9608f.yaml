          notes:
          - Trust allows the owner [or his agent] to act with a higher potential risk
            because the expected risk has been lowered. This is slightly different
            from the plain language of trust. Normally, trust requires something,
            but if the principal at risk decides that no risk exists, then trust exists
            (in the sense here) because risk has been reduced, whatever the reason.
