  notes:
  - content: The mail recipient is normally the addressee, the mailee or an authorized
      representative of one of these two. However, this might not always be the case,
      e.g. if the postal item is left for collection in a location to which third
      parties have access; if the addressee/mailee have moved without leaving forwarding
      instructions or if the addressee or mailee specification was ambiguous and was,
      as a result, misinterpreted by the postal operator
