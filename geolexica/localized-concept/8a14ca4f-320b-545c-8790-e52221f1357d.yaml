  definition:
  - content: relationship between two domains such that there is a structure-preserving
      function from one to the other
  examples: []
  id: '2168'
  notes:
  - content: A homomorphism is distinct from a isomorphism in that no inverse function
      is required. In an isomorphism, there are two homomorphisms that are functional
      inverses of one another. Continuous functions are topological homomorphisms
      because they preserve "topological characteristics". The mapping of topological
      complexes to their geometric realizations preserves the concept of boundary
      and is therefore a homomorphism.
