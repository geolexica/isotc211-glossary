          notes:
          - Relative accuracy may also be referred to as point-to-point accuracy.
            The general measure of relative accuracy is an evaluation of the random
            errors (systematic errors and blunders removed) in determining the positional
            orientation (for example, distance and azimuth) of one point or feature
            with respect to another. In lidar, this also may specifically mean the
            accuracy between adjacent swaths within a lift, adjacent lifts within
            a project, or between adjacent projects.
