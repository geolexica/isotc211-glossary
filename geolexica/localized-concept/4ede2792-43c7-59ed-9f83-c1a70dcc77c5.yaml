          notes:
          - When applicable, measurement uncertainty should be taken into consideration.
          - The item may be, e.g. a process, measurement procedure, material, compound,
            or measuring system.
          - The specified requirements may be, e.g. that a manufacturer's specifications
            are met.
          - Verification should not be confused with calibration. Not every verification
            is a validation.
