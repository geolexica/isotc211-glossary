  - content: common root classifier of a category which is a superclass of any other
      classifier in the category

  id: '2028'
  notes:
  - content: The class Any in some programming languages is the abstract root of all
      classes. Thus, it is the de facto union of all classes. In this document, Geometry
      is the (named and explicit) abstract root for all geometry objects. In the package
      Geometry and any of its subpackages (including those in its Requirements Classes),
      any interface will be a subtype of Geometry either directly or transitively.
