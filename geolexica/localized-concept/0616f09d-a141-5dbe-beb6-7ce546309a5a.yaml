  definition:
  - content: form of aggregation which requires that a part instance be included in
      at most one composite at a time, and that the composite object is responsible
      for the creation and destruction of the parts
  examples: []
  id: '725'
  notes:
  - content: 'Parts with non-fixed multiplicity may be created after the composite
      itself, but once created they live and die with it (i.e., they share lifetimes).
      Such parts can also be explicitly removed before the death of the composite.
      Composition may be recursive. Synonym: composite aggregation.'
