          notes:
          - The direction is usually specified to be north. In some communities the
            term bearing refers specifically to grid north and directions relative
            to true north are then termed ‘azimuth’; in other communities a bearing
            refers specifically to true north. In this International Standard bearing
            is used for any specified reference direction. The angle may be reckoned
            positive clockwise or positive counter-clockwise depending upon the application.
