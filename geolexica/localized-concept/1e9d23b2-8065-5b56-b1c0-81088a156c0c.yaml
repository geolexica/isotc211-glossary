          notes:
          - An implementation coverage is a concrete document in some concrete encoding,
            such as a GeoTIFF file.
          - The definition of implementation coverage in this standard is functionally
            identical to GML coverage as defined in the OGC Coverage Implementation
            Schema [OGC 09-146r2].
