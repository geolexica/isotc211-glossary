  notes:
  - content: Uncertainty of measurement comprises, in general, many components. Some
      of these components may be evaluated from the statistical distribution of the
      results of series of measurements and can be characterized by experimental standard
      deviations. The other components, which can also be characterized by standard
      deviations, are evaluated from assumed probability distributions based on experience
      or other information.
