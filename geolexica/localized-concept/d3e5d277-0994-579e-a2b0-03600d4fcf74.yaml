          notes:
          - Postal address sub-elements are used to facilitate postal address rendering,
            database storage and related technical needs and should not be considered
            as specific cases of postal address components.
          - Postal address sub-elements are further described in 6.5.
          - For convenience, the preferred term “postal address sub-element” has been
            shortened to the admitted term “sub-element” throughout this document.
