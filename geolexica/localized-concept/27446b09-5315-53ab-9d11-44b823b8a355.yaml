          definition: form of aggregation which requires that a part instance be included
            in at most one composite at a time, and that the composite object is responsible
            for the creation and destruction of the parts

          - 'Parts with non-fixed multiplicity may be created after the composite
            itself, but once created they live and die with it (i.e., they share lifetimes).
            Such parts can also be explicitly removed before the death of the composite.
            Composition may be recursive. Synonym: composite aggregation.'
