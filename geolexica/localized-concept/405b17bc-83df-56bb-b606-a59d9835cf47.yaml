          notes:
          - Maneuvers are used to cluster turns into convenient and legal combinations.
            They may be as simple as a single turn, a combination of quick turns ("jogs"
            in the American mid-west consisting of a turn followed immediately by
            a turn in the opposite direction) or very complex combinations consisting
            of entry, exit, and connecting roadways  ("magic roundabouts" in the UK).
