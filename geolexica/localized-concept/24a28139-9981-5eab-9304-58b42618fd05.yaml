          - Rights can be by law (copyright), by agreement, or by contract [the licence
            agreement]. In the case of digital commerce, DRM ensures that licences
            are adhered to, and that rights holders are compensated as appropriate
            for each transaction. Agents of the original rights holder can also issue
            licences, but their ability is only under the agency contract to the original
            principal.
