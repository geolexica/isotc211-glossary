  - content: height that is dependent on the Earthâ€™s gravity field
  examples: []
  id: '2371'
  notes:
  - content: This refers to, amongst others, orthometric height and Normal height,
      which are both approximations of the distance of a point above the mean sea
      level, but also may include Normal-orthometric heights, dynamic heights or geopotential
      numbers.
  - content: The distance from the reference surface may follow a curved line, not
      necessarily straight, as it is influenced by the direction of gravity.
