  - content: A directed edge that is in agreement with the orientation of the edge
      has a + orientation, otherwise, it has the opposite (-) orientation. Directed
      edge is used in topology to distinguish the right side (-) from the left side
      (+) of the same edge and the start node (-) and end node (+) of the same edge
      and in computational topology to represent these concepts.
