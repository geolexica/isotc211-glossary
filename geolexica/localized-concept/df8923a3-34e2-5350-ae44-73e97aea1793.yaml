  definition:
  - content: directed topological object that represents an association between a
      face and one of its orientations
  examples: []
  id: 137

  lineage_source_similarity: 1
  notes:
  - content: The orientation of the directed edges that compose the exterior boundary
      of a directed face will appear positive from the direction of this vector; the
      orientation of a directed face that bounds a topological solid will point away
      from the topological solid. Adjacent solids would use different orientations
      for their shared boundary, consistent with the same sort of association between
      adjacent faces and their shared edges. Directed faces are used in the coboundary
      relation to maintain the spatial association between face and edge.
