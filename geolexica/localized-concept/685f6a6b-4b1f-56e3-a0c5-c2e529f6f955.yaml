  definition:
  - content: spatial, spatio-temporal or temporal unit of geometry with dimensionality
      greater than 0, associated with a zone
  examples: []
  id: '2649'
  notes:
  - content: All cells within a DGGS share the dimensionality of the DGGS's parent
      global geometry. DGGSs with dimensionality of 0 are not supported.
  - content: Cells are the unit of geometry in a DGGS, and the geometry of the region
      of space-time occupied by a zone is a cell.
  - content: While the terms cell and zone are often used interchangeably, "zone"
      is the strictly preferred term. Cell is entirely appropriate when specifically
      discussing a zone's geometry or topology.
