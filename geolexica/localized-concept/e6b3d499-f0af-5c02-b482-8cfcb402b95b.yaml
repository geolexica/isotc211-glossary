  - content: realization of a terrestrial reference system (TRS), by specifying its
      origin, orientation, scale, and its time evolution
  examples: []
  id: 2490
  language_code: eng
  notes:
  - content: The realization is achieved through a set of physical points with precisely
      determined coordinates in a specific coordinate system, which may include the
      rate of coordinate change.
  - content: The realization is called static when no rates of coordinate change are
      defined, and kinematic when rates of coordinate change are defined without considering
      the underlying forces causing the motion. The realization may be called dynamic
      when these external forces are considered. "Dynamic" is also used colloquially
      to describe both the dynamic and kinematic cases without distinction.
