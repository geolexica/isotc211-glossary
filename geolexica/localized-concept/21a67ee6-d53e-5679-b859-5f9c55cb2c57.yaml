  - content: representation, using a local origin and local ordinate vectors, of a
      geometric object at a given reference time
  examples: []
  id: '717'
  notes:
  - content: A rigid geometric object may undergo translation or rotation, but remains
      congruent with its base representation.
  - content: The local origin and ordinate vectors establish an engineering coordinate
      reference system (ISO 19111), also called a local frame or a local Euclidean
      coordinate system.
