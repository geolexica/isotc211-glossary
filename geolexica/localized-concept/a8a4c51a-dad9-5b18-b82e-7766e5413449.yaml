  notes:
  - content: The rotor spins on a fixed axis while the structure around it rotates
      or tilts. In airplanes, the pitch and orientation of the airplane is measured
      against the steady spin of the gyroscope. In space, where the four compass points
      are meaningless, the gyroscope's axis of rotation is used as a reference point
      for navigation. An inertial navigation system includes three gimbal-mounted
      gyroscopes, used to measure roll, pitch, and yaw.
