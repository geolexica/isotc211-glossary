          notes:
          - The usual distance function for two points in a coordinate space assumes
            an underlying plane and is a Euclidean distance. If the underlying Reference
            Surface is not a plane, then distance is defined by this minimum length
            of all curves between the two points. These surfaces are prime examples
            of non-Euclidean geometry, where the parallel postulate in Euclid's Elements
            does not hold. In mathematical terms, distance is the "greatest lower
            bound" of the length of the curves. The word minimum is sometimes used,
            but there should be no expectation that an instance of that minimum actually
            occurs, only that any larger number will have a length in the set that
            is smaller.
