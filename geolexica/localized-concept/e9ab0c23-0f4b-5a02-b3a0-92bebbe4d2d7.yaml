  notes:
  - content: The usual distance function for two points in a coordinate space assumes
      an underlying plane and is a Euclidean distance. If the underlying Reference
      Surface is not a plane, then distance is defined by this minimum length of all
      curves between the two points. These surfaces are prime examples of non-Euclidean
      geometry, where the parallel postulate in Euclid's Elements does not hold. In
      mathematical terms, distance is the "greatest lower bound" of the length of
      the curves. The word minimum is sometimes used, but there should be no expectation
      that an instance of that minimum actually occurs, only that any larger number
      will have a length in the set that is smaller.
