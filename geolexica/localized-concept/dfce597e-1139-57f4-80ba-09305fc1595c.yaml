  definition:
  - content: bilinear, symmetric function from pairs of vectors `<< vec v_1, vec v_2
      >> rarr RR` to a real number such that `<< vec v, vec v >> = norm (vec v)` and
      `<< vec v_1, vec v_2>> = norm (vec v_1) norm (vec v_2) cos theta` where "`theta`"
      is the angle between `vec v_1` and `vec v_2`.
