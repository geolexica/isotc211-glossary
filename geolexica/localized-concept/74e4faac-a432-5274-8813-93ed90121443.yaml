          definition: calibration of a lidar sensor system, equipped with an Inertial
            Measurement Unit (IMU) and a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS),
            to accurately determine or establish its position and orientation

          notes:
          - The position of the lidar sensor system (x, y, z) is determined with respect
            to the GNSS antenna. The orientation (roll, pitch, heading) of the lidar
            sensor system is determined with respect to straight and level flight.
