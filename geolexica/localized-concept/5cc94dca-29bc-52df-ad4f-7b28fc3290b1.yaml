  notes:
  - content: A LIDAR system which employs this technology typically uses processing
      techniques to develop the time-of-flight measurements from the full waveform
      that is reflected from the targets in the illuminated scene of interest. These
      time-of-flight measurements are then combined with precise platform location/attitude
      data along with pointing data to produce a three-dimensional product of the
      illuminated scene of interest.
