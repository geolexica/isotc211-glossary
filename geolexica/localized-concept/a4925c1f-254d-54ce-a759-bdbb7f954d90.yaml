  notes:
  - content: When the quality of accuracy or precision of measured values, such as
      coordinates, is to be characterized quantitatively, the quality parameter is
      an estimate of the uncertainty of the measurement results. Because accuracy
      is a qualitative concept, one should not use it quantitatively, that is associate
      numbers with it; numbers should be associated with measures of uncertainty instead.
