          notes:
          - Cycles are used to describe boundary components (see shell, ring). A cycle
            has no boundary because it closes on itself, but it is bounded (i.e.,
            it does not have infinite extent).  A circle or a sphere, for example,
            has no boundary, but is bounded.
