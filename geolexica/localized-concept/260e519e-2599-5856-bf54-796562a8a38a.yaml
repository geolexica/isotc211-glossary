  notes:
  - content: This rule represents what is "most natural" to do at a node (intersection),
      given the entry link used. The most common version is "as straight as possible",
      or to exit a turn on the most obvious extension of the entry street, which is
      usually, but not always, the same named street that was the entry. Every node
      in a route is either associated with an instruction or can be navigated by the
      main-road rule.
