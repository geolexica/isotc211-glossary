          - Payment providers can be telephone and cellular companies, banks, credit
            card corporations, ISPs, network operators, and utility companies. The
            payment provider bills the consumer, deducts a fee, and forwards the payment
            to the content provider. The payment provider is thus responsible for
            the balancing of accounts.
