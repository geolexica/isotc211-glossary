  - content: geometric reference surface embedded in 3D Euclidean space represented
      by an ellipsoid of revolution where the rotation is about the polar axis

  notes:
  - content: For the Earth the rotation is about the polar axis. This results in an
      oblate ellipsoid with midpoint of the foci located at the nominal centre of
      the Earth.
  - content: The two usual algorithms for latitude on an ellipsoid and on a sphere
      (such as used in spherical coordinates) are only equivalent if the ellipsoid
      is a sphere, having all radii equal in all directions. The problem is that a
      radial line from the centre of a general ellipsoid does not always cross the
      surface of the ellipsoid orthogonally. In general, planar slices through the
      centre do not intersect the surface orthogonally, and therefore the curves that
      correspond to the great circles of a sphere are not geodesics on the ellipsoid.
  - content: The topology of the ellipsoid is inherited from the ùîº3 space in which
      it is embedded. The difference is that metrics such as distance and direction
      on the ellipsoid are restricted to curves wholly on the surface and vectors
      tangent to the surface.at
