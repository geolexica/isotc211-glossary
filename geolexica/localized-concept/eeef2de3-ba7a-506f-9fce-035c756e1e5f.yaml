  definition:
  - content: "largest number n such that each point in a set of points can be associated
      with a subset that has that point in its interior and is topologically isomorphic
      to \U0001D53Cn, Euclidean n-space"

  notes:
  - content: Curves, because they are continuous images of a portion of the real line,
      have geometric dimension 1. Surfaces cannot always be mapped to stem:[RR^2]
      in their entirety, but around each point position, a small neighborhood can
      be found that resembles (under continuous functions) the interior of the unit
      circle in stem:[RR^2], and are therefore 2-dimensional. In this document, most
      surfaces (instances of Surface) are mapped to portions of stem:[RR^2] by their
      defining interpolation mechanisms.
