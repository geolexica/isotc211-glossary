  notes:
  - content: The universal face is normally not part of any feature, and is used to
      represent the unbounded portion of the data set. Its interior boundary (it has
      no exterior boundary) would normally be considered the exterior boundary of
      the map represented by the data set. This International Standard does not special
      case the universal face, but application schemas may find it convenient to do
      so.
