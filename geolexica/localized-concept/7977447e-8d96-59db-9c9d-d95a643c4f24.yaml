          notes:
          - In most cases, the vertical reference frame will be related to mean sea
            level. Vertical datums include sounding datums (used for hydrographic
            purposes), in which case the heights may be negative heights or depths.
          - Ellipsoidal heights are related to a three-dimensional ellipsoidal coordinate
            system referenced to a geodetic reference frame.
