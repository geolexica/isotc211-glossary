  notes:
  - content: A transfer node may contain other transfer nodes and may be related to
      one or more transport modes and transport networks. It may also contain stop
      points and facilities for the users of the transfer node. A transfer node may
      host services that are provided to the users of the transfer node, e.g. information
      services, ticket sales, etc.
  - content: A transfer node may be a part of a hierarchy of transfer nodes. Thus,
      a transfer node may be related to many transport modes and transport networks.
      However, only transfer nodes that are related to just one transport network
      will have stop points.
  - content: The stop points related to different transfer nodes, which may serve
      different transport modes and networks, may, in real life, have the same physical
      locations. A tram and a bus may for example share the same platform, but conceptually
      they may belong to different transfer nodes.
