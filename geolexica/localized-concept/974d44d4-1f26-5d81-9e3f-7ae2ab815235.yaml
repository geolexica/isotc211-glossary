  - content: Relative accuracy may also be referred to as point-to-point accuracy.
      The general measure of relative accuracy is an evaluation of the random errors
      (systematic errors and blunders removed) in determining the positional orientation
      (for example, distance and azimuth) of one point or feature with respect to
      another. In lidar, this also may specifically mean the accuracy between adjacent
      swaths within a lift, adjacent lifts within a project, or between adjacent projects.
