  definition:
  - content: relationship between two domains (such as two complexes) such that there
      are 1-to-1, structure-preserving functions from each domain onto the other,
      and the composition of the two functions, in either order, is the corresponding
      identity function

  - content: 'A geometric complex is isomorphic to a topological complex if their
      elements are in a 1-to-1, dimension- and boundary-preserving correspondence
      to one another. \[[A,B \textit{ isomorphic}] \Leftrightarrow [\exists f : A
      \rightarrow B, g : B \rightarrow A \backepsilon f \circ g = Id_A, g \circ f
      = Id_B]\]'
