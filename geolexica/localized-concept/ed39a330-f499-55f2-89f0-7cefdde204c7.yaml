  notes:
  - content: The normal mechanism is to apply a cost to each part of a route, and
      to define the total route cost as the sum of the cost of the parts. This is
      necessary for the operation of the most common navigation algorithms. The units
      of cost functions are not limited to monetary costs and values only, but include
      such measures as time, distance, and possibly others. The only requirement is
      that the function be additive and at least non-negative. This last criteria
      can be softened as long as no zero or less cost is associated with any loop
      in the network, as this will prevent the existence of a "minimal cost" route.
