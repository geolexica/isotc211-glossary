          - The normal mechanism is to apply a cost to each part of a route, and to
            define the total route cost as the sum of the cost of the parts. This
            is necessary for the operation of the most common navigation algorithms.
            The units of cost functions are not limited to monetary costs and values
            only, but include such measures as time, distance, and possibly others.
            The only requirement is that the function be additive and at least non-negative.
            This last criteria can be softened as long as no zero or less cost is
            associated with any loop in the network, as this will prevent the existence
            of a "minimal cost" route.
