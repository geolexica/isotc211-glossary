          notes:
          - In this International Standard, the term ”transport mode” is frequently
            shortened to “mode” for convenience. Transport mode is usually covering
            groups of vehicles, e.g. transport means used for road transport, rail
            transport, sea transport, air transport and cable transport. A mode for
            inland water-borne transport is also added.
