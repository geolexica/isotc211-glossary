  notes:
  - content: Maneuvers are used to cluster turns into convenient and legal combinations.
      They may be as simple as a single turn, a combination of quick turns ("jogs"
      in the American mid-west consisting of a turn followed immediately by a turn
      in the opposite direction) or very complex combinations consisting of entry,
      exit, and connecting roadways  ("magic roundabouts" in the UK).
