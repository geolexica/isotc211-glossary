  notes:
  - content: Performance indicators can be used as quality-control evidence of the
      positioning system and/or positioning solution. Internal quality control may
      include such factors as signal strength of received radio signals [signal-to-noise
      ratio (SNR)], figures indicating the dilution of precision (DOP) due to geometric
      constraints in radiolocation systems, and system-specific figure of merit (FOM).
