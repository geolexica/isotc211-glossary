  notes:
  - content: A passive object is usually accessed through an external interface, through
      which it receives requests, processes those requests and returns data as a response
      to that request. Since objects can implement more than one type, it is possible
      for a single object to pass through active and passive states. For example,
      a tracking service can lie dormant until a tracking request activates a period
      where the internals of the object initiate tracking activities based on internal
      triggers as specified within the request. When the tracking request is deactivated,
      the object may return to a passive state.
