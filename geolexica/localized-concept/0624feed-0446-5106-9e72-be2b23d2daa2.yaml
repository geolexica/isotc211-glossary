          notes:
          - A LIDAR system which employs this technology typically uses processing
            techniques to develop the time-of-flight measurements from the full waveform
            that is reflected from the targets in the illuminated scene of interest.
            These time-of-flight measurements are then combined with precise platform
            location/attitude data along with pointing data to produce a three-dimensional
            product of the illuminated scene of interest.
