          notes:
          - A feature attribute has a name, a data type, and a value domain associated
            to it.  A feature attribute for a feature instance also has an attribute
            value taken from the value domain.
          - In a feature catalogue, a feature attribute may include a value domain
            but does not specify attribute values for feature instances.
