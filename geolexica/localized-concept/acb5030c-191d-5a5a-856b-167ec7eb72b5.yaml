          definition: property of a geometric object implying that any two points
            on the object can be placed on a curve that remains totally within the

          notes:
          - There are more general geometries that are connected but not path connected,
            but they are not representable as collections of "digital" geometries
            defined in this document. No geometric objects constructible by the methods
            in this document on a standard digital computer can be connected but not
            path connected. See the notes at the term "connected"
