  definition:
  - content: first derivative of a curve parameterized by arc length
  examples: []
  id: '2095'
  notes:
  - content: If stem:[c(s) = (x(s), y(s), z(s))] is a curve in a 3D Cartesian space
      (stem:[bbb"E"^3]), and stem:[s] is arc length along stem:[c], then the tangent
      is stem:[vec tau(s) = dot c(s) = (dot x(s), dot y(s), dot z(s))], i.e. the derivative
      of the coordinate values of stem:[c] with respect to stem:[s]. The curvature
      vector is stem:[kappa(s) = ddot c(s) = (ddot x(s), ddot y(s), ddot z(s))].
