  definition:
  - content: responsivity per unit wavelength interval at a given wavelength
  examples: []
  id: '1608'
  notes:
  - content: The spectral responsivity is the response of the sensor with respect
      to the wavelengths dependent radiance.
  - content: The definition is described mathematically in IEC 60050-845. The spectral
      responsivity is quotient of the detector output stem:["d"Y(lambda)] by the monochromatic
      detector input stem:["d"X_"e"(lambda) = X_"e", ""_lambda(lambda) * "d"lambda]
      in the wavelength interval stem:["d"lambda] as a function of the wavelength
      stem:[lambda]  stem:[s(lambda) = ("d"Y(lambda))/("d"X_"c"(lambda))]
