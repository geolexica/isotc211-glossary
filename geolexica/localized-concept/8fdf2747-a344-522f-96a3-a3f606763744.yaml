          definition: structured information that allows the unambiguous determination
            of an object for purposes of identification and location
          entry_status: valid
          examples:
          - 'Address where the object is a business: 611 Fifth Avenue, New York NY
            10022.'
          - 'Address where the object is a building: Lombardy House, 809 Lombardy
            Street, The Hills, 0039, South Africa.'
          - 'Address where the object is a land parcel for a building: San 4–5, Munjae-ro,
            Songpa-gu, Seoul, 13144, South Korea.'
          - 'Address where the object is a building group, such as a school or large
            apartment area: 228-dong 404-ho, 26 Kyunghee-daero, Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul
            130–701, South Korea.'

          notes:
          - The object is identifiable in the real world, i.e. electronic and virtual
            addresses are excluded.
          - “Identification” refers to the fact that the structured information in
            the address unambiguously determines the object, i.e. it helps the human
            to identify the object. In other words, “identification” here does not
            refer to unique identifiers in a database or dataset.
          - There can be many addresses for an object, but at any moment (or lifecycle
            stage), an address unambiguously determines a single object (see ISO 19160-1:2015,
            Annex D for examples).
          - Two addresses from two different address classes (i.e. they have different
            sets of components) for the same addressable object are two different
            addresses (refer to ISO 19160-1:2015, Annex E for more examples).
          - Two addresses for the same addressable object and from the same address
            class, but in two different languages are two different addresses (refer
            to ISO 19160-1:2015, Annex E for more examples).
          - In addition to the addressable object, there may be a multitude of people,
            organizations, addressees or other objects associated with an address.
            These are external to the address model (refer to ISO 19160-1:2015, Annex
            C and Annex F for examples).
