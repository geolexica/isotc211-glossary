          notes:
          - Coordinates of points on or near the crust of the Earth that are referenced
            to a dynamic coordinate reference system may change with time, usually
            due to crustal deformations such as tectonic motion and glacial isostatic
            adjustment.
          - Metadata for a dataset referenced to a dynamic coordinate reference system
            should include coordinate epoch information.
