          notes:
          - Some projections are conformal. For example, a Mercator preserves the
            angle between curves, so that if two curves in a Mercator projected plane
            cross at a 90째, then the preimage curves on the ellipsoid also cross at
            90째, such as lines of constant latitude and lines of constant longitude.
