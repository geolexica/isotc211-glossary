  definition:
  - content: storage mechanism for multidimensional array in linear memory, organized
      such that each row is stored in consecutive locations and such that the complete
      rows are the stored one after the other and continuing on is a similar fashion
      of each additional index
  examples: []
  id: '2176'
  notes:
  - content: 'If the indexes are stem:[(i, j)] with the number of rows stem:[r] and
      columns stem:[c], then the mapping between the multidimensional locations to
      the linear storage locations is given by: latexmath:[[i,j \in \mathbb{Z} \backepsilon
      1 \leq i \leq r; 1 \leq j \leq c] \implies [(i,j) \rightarrow (i-1)c + j]] latexmath:[[i,j,k
      \in \mathbb{Z} \backepsilon 1 \leq i \leq r; 1 \leq j \leq c; 1 \leq k \leq
      f] \implies [(i,j,k) \rightarrow ((i-1)c + j -1)f + k]]'
  - content: 'The matrix stem:[[[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]] in row major form is stored
      as stem:[[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]]. For higher dimensions, the same pattern
      is applied recursively:'
