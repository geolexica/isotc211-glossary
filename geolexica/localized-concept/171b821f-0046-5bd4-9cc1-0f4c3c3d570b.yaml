  notes:
  - content: Compare with integration. While the conceptual schema of the information
      transferred shall be agreed upon to some level, coupling applications can be
      and are usually flexible in the data representation of that information as long
      as the semantics content is correct and mappable to some canonical representation
      of the conceptual schema. The most common mapping technology used for XML messages
      is XSLT, and the transformation stylesheet can be supplied either by the service
      broker or by the service provider. It is considered a best practice for a service
      provider to supply his functionality through several logically equivalent messaging
      APIs, each represented by a different URI linked to an XSLT transformation bridge,
      and implemented by the same internal code.
  - content: Loose coupling and tight coupling are not at present well-defined terms
      in the literature. Generally, "tight" coupling means that there is some sort
      of incurred dependency between requester and responder in the use of the interface,
      while "loose" means no such dependency. The nature of that dependency is not
      consistently defined between authors.  In that light, "tight" coupling or "tight"
      integration are both bad practices, and have been viewed as such since the inception
      of the terms. Some literature refers to integration as "tight coupling", but
      that is a less accurate description.
