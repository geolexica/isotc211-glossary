  notes:
  - content: Time of flight (TOF) LIDARs use short laser pulses and precisely record
      the time each laser pulse was emitted and the time each reflected return(s)
      is received in order to calculate the distance(s) to the scatterer(s) encountered
      by the emitted pulse. For topographic LIDAR, these time-of-flight measurements
      are then combined with precise platform location/attitude data along with pointing
      data to produce a three-dimensional product of the illuminated scene of interest.
