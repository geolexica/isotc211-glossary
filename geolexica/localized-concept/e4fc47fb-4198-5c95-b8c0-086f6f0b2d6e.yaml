          notes:
          - The concept "measurement accuracy" is not a quantity and is not given
            a numerical quantity value. A measurement is said to be more accurate
            when it offers a smaller measurement error.
          - The term "measurement accuracy" should not be used for measurement trueness
            and the term measurement precision should not be used for "measurement
            accuracy", which, however, is related to both these concepts.
          - '"Measurement accuracy" is sometimes understood as closeness of agreement
            between measured quantity values that are being attributed to the measurand.'
