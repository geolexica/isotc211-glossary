          notes:
          - This rule represents what is "most natural" to do at a node (intersection),
            given the entry link used. The most common version is "as straight as
            possible", or to exit a turn on the most obvious extension of the entry
            street, which is usually, but not always, the same named street that was
            the entry. Every node in a route is either associated with an instruction
            or can be navigated by the main-road rule.
