  notes:
  - content: 'In a metric space, a set stem:[X] us open if each point stem:[x] in
      the set is contained in some small ball which is a subset of stem:[X]: latexmath:[[X
      \text{ is open}] \Leftrightarrow [x \in X] \implies [\exists \varepsilon > 0
      \backepsilon \text{distance} (x,y) < \varepsilon] \implies [y \in X]]. A topology
      is a set of subsets of a space which are considered open.'
