  notes:
  - content: Radar cross section is calculated as `sigma = lim_(R ->oo) 4 pi R^2 (abs(E_s)^2)
      / (abs(E_i)^2)` where `sigma` is the radar cross section; `E_i` is the electric-field
      strength of the incident wave; `E_s` is the electric-field strength of the scattered
      wave at the radar with a distance `R` away from the target.
  - content: 'Â 2 to entry: Radar cross section has the dimensions of area, with the
      unit of square metres. Usually, it is expressed in the form of a logarithm with
      the unit of dBsm as follows `sigma_(dBsm) = 10 log_(10) sigma`'
