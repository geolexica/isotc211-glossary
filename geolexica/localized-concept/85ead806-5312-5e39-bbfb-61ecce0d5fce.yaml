          - Radar cross section is calculated as `sigma = lim_(R ->oo) 4 pi R^2 (abs(E_s)^2)
            / (abs(E_i)^2)` where `sigma` is the radar cross section; `E_i` is the
            electric-field strength of the incident wave; `E_s` is the electric-field
            strength of the scattered wave at the radar with a distance `R` away from
            the target.
          - ' 2 to entry: Radar cross section has the dimensions of area, with the
            unit of square metres. Usually, it is expressed in the form of a logarithm
            with the unit of dBsm as follows `sigma_(dBsm) = 10 log_(10) sigma`'
