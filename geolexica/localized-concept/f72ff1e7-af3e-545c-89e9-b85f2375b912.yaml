  notes:
  - content: The effect is a result of Bernoulli's principle of fluid dynamics. The
      squat represents the increase in effective draught.
  - content: For a ship underway, the change of level of the bow and stern from the
      still water condition in response to the elevation and depression of the water
      level about the hull resulting from the bow and stern wave systems.
