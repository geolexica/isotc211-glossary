  definition:
  - content: projection of the curvature vector of the curve perpendicular to the
      tangent plane to the surface at the point
  examples: []
  id: '2243'
  notes:
  - content: The normal curvature vector of a curve is dependent only on the curve
      and the surface (which is a constraint on the curve). The normal curvature vector
      of a curve restricted to a surface is parallel to the normal vector of the surface.
      If the normal curvature vector is equal to the curvature vector of the curve
      everywhere, then the curve is a geodesic.
