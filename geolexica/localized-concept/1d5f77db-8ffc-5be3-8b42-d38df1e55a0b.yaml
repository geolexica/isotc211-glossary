  definition:
  - content: second derivative of a curve parameterized by arc length, at a point
  examples: []
  id: 2041
  language_code: eng
  notes:
  - content: If `c(s) = (x(s), y(s), z(s))` is a curve in a 3D Cartesian space (`bbb"E"^3`),
      and `s` is the arc length along `c(s)`, then the unit tangent vector is `dot
      c(s) = (dot x(s), dot y(s), dot z(s))`, i.e. the derivative of the coordinate
      values of `c` with respect to `s`. The curvature vector is `ddot c(s) = (ddot
      x(s), ddot y(s), ddot z(s))`. The curvature vector can be approximated by the
      inverse of the radius of a circle through any 3 nearby points on the curve (pointed
      from the curve to towards the centre of the circle)
