          definition: property of a topological space implying that only the entire
            space or the empty set are the only subsets which are both open and closed

          notes:
          - The formal definition of connected is that any pair of locally open sets
            whose union is the entire space must have a non-empty intersection.   \(\text{a
            topological space T is connected if and only if } [\forall X,Y \subset
            T \backepsilon X \cup Y = T] \implies [X \cap Y \ne \emptyset]\) This
            formal definition is difficult to use. The term path connected, defined
            below is equivalent for the purposed of this document. The use or "finite
            precision" coordinates makes sets which are connected but not path connected
            impossible to represent. In all cases "connected" is used, but "path connected"
            is easier to test and to visualize.
