  notes:
  - content: The most common tracking devices are cell phones, GNSS chips, RFID (Radio
      Frequency ID) tags, or printed tags which are scanable by optical sensors  such
      as "bar codes".
  - content: The common usage of  "vehicle" means a "form of conveyance" or, more
      simply "thing that conveys (carries) something else".  Thus, a tracked object
      that carries a tracking device to allow it to be tracked is, by definition,
      a conveyance or vehicle for that device.  Thus, a cell phone that carries a
      GNSS device is the vehicle for that device, and the traveller carrying the cell
      phone, allowing him to be tracked, is the vehicle for the phone and all of its
      internal electronics.
