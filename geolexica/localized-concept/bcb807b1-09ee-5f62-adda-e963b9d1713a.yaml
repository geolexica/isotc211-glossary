  notes:
  - content: An n-simplex is n-dimensional, and is topological isomorphic to an n-disc.
      A 0-simplex is a point. A 1-simplex is a curve (usually a line) with two 0-simplexes
      (points) on its boundary; a 2-simplex is a triangular surface with three 1-simplices
      on its boundary. In general, an n-simplex boundary will have n (n−1)-simplexes.
      An n-simplex and an n-disc are topologically isomorphic. The boundary of an
      n-simplex is isomorphic to an (n−1)-sphere. In all cases, the number prefix
      represents the topological dimension of the object.
