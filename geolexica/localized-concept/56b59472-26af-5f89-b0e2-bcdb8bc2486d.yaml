  notes:
  - content: The concept "measurement accuracy" is not a quantity and is not given
      a numerical quantity value. A measurement is said to be more accurate when it
      offers a smaller measurement error.
  - content: The term "measurement accuracy" should not be used for measurement trueness
      and the term measurement precision should not be used for "measurement accuracy",
      which, however, is related to both these concepts.
  - content: '"Measurement accuracy" is sometimes understood as closeness of agreement
      between measured quantity values that are being attributed to the measurand.'
