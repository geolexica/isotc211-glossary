          notes:
          - Temporal sequences are not assumed to be evenly spaced in time, nor equidistance
            in space. For discrete change, the default logic is to sample at temporal
            points of change if possible, so that the timestamp is the first temporal
            instance where the attributes listed have taken on that combination of
            values. For sake of space savings, some samples in a sequence only list
            those values that have changed since the immediately preceding temporal
            sample. For this reason, a sample should only be considered in the context
            of its containing sequence. For rigid motions (such as vehicle tracking),
            only centroid (a point value) and orientation (direction of travel) are
            needed for a temporal sequence describing location and spatial extent.
            A motion in combination with an object deformation would require more
            information.
