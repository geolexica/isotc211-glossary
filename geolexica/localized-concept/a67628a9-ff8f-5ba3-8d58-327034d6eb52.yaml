  definition:
  - content: horizontal angle at a point relative to a specified direction
  examples: []
  id: '1658'
  notes:
  - content: The direction is usually specified to be north. In some communities the
      term bearing refers specifically to grid north and directions relative to true
      north are then termed ‘azimuth’; in other communities a bearing refers specifically
      to true north. In this International Standard bearing is used for any specified
      reference direction. The angle may be reckoned positive clockwise or positive
      counter-clockwise depending upon the application.
