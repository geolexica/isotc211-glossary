  definition:
  - content: digital elevation model (DEM) that incorporates the elevation of important
      topographic features on the land.
  examples: []
  id: '1936'
  notes:
  - content: DTMs are comprised of mass points and breaklines that are irregularly
      spaced to better characterize the true shape of the bare-earth terrain. The
      net result of DTMs is that the distinctive terrain features are more clearly
      defined and precisely located, and contours generated from DTMs more closely
      approximate the real shape of the terrain.
