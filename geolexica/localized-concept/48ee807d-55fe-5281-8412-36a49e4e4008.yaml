  definition:
  - content: condition of a link or turn that allows or restricts all traffic's traversal,
      as opposed to a more detailed navigation constraint
  examples: []
  id: '474'
  notes:
  - content: Traversability is usually a function of physical, cultural, or legal
      conditions. If traversable is false, then the object cannot be navigated. This
      effectively removes a link from the usable network. In the case of a node, it
      effectively removes the node and all associated links from the useable network.
      In the case of a turn, it simply removes it from any viable route.  Non-traversable
      entities are not included in maneuvers or routes.
