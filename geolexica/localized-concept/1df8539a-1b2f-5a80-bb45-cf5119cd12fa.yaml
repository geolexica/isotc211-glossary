  notes:
  - content: An abstract test case is a formal basis for deriving executable test
      cases One or more test purposes are encapsulated in the abstract test case.
      An abstract test case is independent of both the implementation and the values.
      It should be complete in the sense that it is sufficient to enable a test verdict
      to be assigned unambiguously to each potentially observable test outcome (i.e.
      sequence of test events).
