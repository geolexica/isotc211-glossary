          - An abstract test case is a formal basis for deriving executable test cases
            One or more test purposes are encapsulated in the abstract test case.
            An abstract test case is independent of both the implementation and the
            values. It should be complete in the sense that it is sufficient to enable
            a test verdict to be assigned unambiguously to each potentially observable
            test outcome (i.e. sequence of test events).
