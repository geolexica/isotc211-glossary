          - Stereotypes must be based on certain existing types or classes in the
            metamodel. Stereotypes may extend the semantics, but not the structure
            of pre-existing types and classes. Certain stereotypes are predefined
            in the UML, others may be user defined. Stereotypes are one of three extensibility
            mechanisms in UML. The others are constraint and tagged value.
