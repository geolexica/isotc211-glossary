          notes:
          - A directed edge that is in agreement with the orientation of the edge
            has a + orientation, otherwise, it has the opposite (-) orientation. Directed
            edge is used in topology to distinguish the right side (-) from the left
            side (+) of the same edge and the start node (-) and end node (+) of the
            same edge and in computational topology to represent these concepts.
