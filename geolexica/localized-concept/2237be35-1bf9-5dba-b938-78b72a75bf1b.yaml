  notes:
  - content: The coordinate dimension represents the number of choices made, and constraints
      can restrict choices. A barycentric coordinate which has (n+1)-offsets, but
      the underlying space is dimension n. Homogeneous coordinates (wx, wy, wz, w)
      are actually 3 dimensional because the choice of "w" does not affect the position,
      i.e. (wx, wy, wz, w) = (x y, z, 1) â†’ (x, y, z) which is not affected by w. The
      dimension will be at most the count of the numbers in the coordinate, but it
      can be less if the coordinates are constrained in some manner.asie
