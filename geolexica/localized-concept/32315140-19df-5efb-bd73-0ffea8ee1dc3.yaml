  notes:
  - content: 'Digital migration is distinguished from transfers in general by three
      attributes:  — a focus on the preservation of the full information content that
      needs preservation; —  a perspective that the new archival implementation of
      the information is a replacement for the old; —  an understanding that full
      control and responsibility over all aspects of the transfer resides with the
      OAIS.'
