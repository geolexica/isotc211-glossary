  notes:
  - content: The geodesic circles centred on a pole (either one) are the lines of
      constant latitude. Circles in a tangent space centred on the origin (corresponding
      to the point of tangency) map to geodesic circles by the exponential map on
      the geometric reference surface centred on the point of tangency.
