  - content: 'From the XML Information Set: "Each XML document contains one or more
      elements, the boundaries of which are either delimited by start-tags and end-tags,
      or, for empty elements, by an empty-element tag. Each element has a type, identified
      by name, sometimes called its ''generic identifier'' (GI), and may have a set
      of attribute specifications. Each attribute specification has a name and a value.'
