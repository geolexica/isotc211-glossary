  definition:
  - content: set of four real quantities, which completely describe the polarization
      state of monochromatic or quasi-monochromatic radiation
  examples: []
  id: '2698'
  notes:
  - content: The parameters are, collectively, known as the Stokes Real {ordered},
      a stem:[4 xx 1] Real {ordered}.
  - content: |-
      The Stokes parameters were introduced as a mathematically convenient alternative by Sir George Stokes.[14,17] These four parameters are related to the horizontally and vertically polarized components of electric field by: stem:[[[I],[Q],[U],[V]] = 1/eta [[(:abs(E_"v")^2:)+(:abs(E_"h"):)^2],[(:abs(E_"v"):)^2-(:abs(E_"h"):)^2],[2"Re"(:E_"v"E_"h"^**:)],[2"Im"(:E_"v"E_"h"^**:)]]]

      where

      stem:[E_"v"] is the vertically polarized component of electric field;
      stem:[E_"h"] is the horizontally polarized component of electric field.

      The units of the Stokes parameters are stem:[W//m^2]. The first Stokes parameter (stem:[I]) gives the total radiation power density, and the second Stokes parameter (stem:[Q]) represents the power density difference between the two linearly polarized components. The third and fourth Stokes parameters (stem:[U] and stem:[V]) describe the correlation between these two components.
  - content: "For microwave remote sensing, modified Stokes parameters are often used.
      Under the Rayleigh-Jeans approximation, the modified Stokes parameters in brightness
      temperature are given by the following formula:[19], [37] stem:[[[T_\"v\"],[T_\"h\"],[T_3],[T_4]]=(lambda^2)/(\"k\"etaB)[[(:abs(E_\"v\")^2:)],[(:abs(E_\"h\")^2:)],[2\"Re\"(:E_\"v\"E_\"h\"^**:)],[2\"Im\"(:E_\"v\"E_\"h\"^**:)]]]
      \nwhere stem:[T_\"v\"], stem:[T_\"h\"], stem:[T_3] and stem:[T_4] are, respectively,
      the vertically and horizontally polarized and the third and fourth Stokes parameters,
      and stem:[B] is the radiometer system bandwidth."
