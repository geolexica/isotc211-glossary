          definition: useful angular width of the beam of electromagnetic energy

          notes:
          - Beam width is usually measured in radians and as the angular width between
            two points that have 50% of the power (3 dB below) of the centre of the
            beam. It is a property of the antenna. Power emitted outside of this angle
            is too little to provide a usable return.
