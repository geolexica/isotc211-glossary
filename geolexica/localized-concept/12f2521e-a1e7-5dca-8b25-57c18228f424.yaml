          notes:
          - Traversability is usually a function of physical, cultural, or legal conditions.
            If traversable is false, then the object cannot be navigated. This effectively
            removes a link from the usable network. In the case of a node, it effectively
            removes the node and all associated links from the useable network. In
            the case of a turn, it simply removes it from any viable route. Non-traversable
            entities are not included in maneuvers or routes.
