          definition: index marks, typically four or eight rigidly connected with
            the camera body, which form images on the film negative and define the
            image coordinate reference system

          - When a camera is calibrated the distances between fiducial marks are precisely
            measured and assigned coordinates that assist in correcting for film distortion.
