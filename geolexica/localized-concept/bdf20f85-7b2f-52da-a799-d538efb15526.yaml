  definition:
  - content: effect that causes a vessel moving through water to create an area of
      lowered pressure under its bottom that increases the effective draught (i.e.
      lowers the vessel in the water)
  examples: []
  id: '1420'
  notes:
  - content: The effect is a result of Bernoulli's principle of fluid dynamics. The
      squat represents the increase in effective draught.
  - content: For a ship underway, the change of level of the bow and stern from the
      still water condition in response to the elevation and depression of the water
      level about the hull resulting from the bow and stern wave systems.
