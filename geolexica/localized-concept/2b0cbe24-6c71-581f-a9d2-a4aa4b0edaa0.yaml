  notes:
  - content: Curves, because they are continuous images of a portion of the real line,
      have geometric dimension 1. Surfaces cannot be mapped to R2 in their entirety,
      but around each point position, a small neighbourhood can be found that resembles
      (under continuous functions) the interior of the unit circle in R2, and are
      therefore 2-dimensional. In this International Standard, most surface patches
      (instances of GM_SurfacePatch) are mapped to portions of R2 by their defining
      interpolation mechanisms.
