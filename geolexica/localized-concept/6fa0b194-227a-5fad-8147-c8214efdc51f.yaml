  - content: position within a network on a link defined by some strictly monotonic
      measure associated with that link
  examples: []
  id: '275'
  notes:
  - content: Link positions are often associated with a target feature that is not
      part of the network. The most common link measures used for this are the distance
      from start node or address. The most common use of a link position is to geolocate
      an "address."
