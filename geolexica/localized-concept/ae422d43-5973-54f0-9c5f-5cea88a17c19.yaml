  notes:
  - content: 'DRM covers a much broader spectrum of capabilities and underlying technologies
      supporting description, identification, trading, protecting, monitoring, and
      tracking of all forms of rights usages for both tangible and intangible (electronic)
      assets, including the management of rights-holders relationships. See, for example,
      Reference [5][of ISO 19153:2014 - Iannella R. Digital Rights Management (DRM)
      Architectures. D-Lib. 2001 June, 7 (6) Available

      at: http://www.dlib.org/dlib/june01/iannella/06iannella.html]. “Digital” refers
      to the material over which the rights exist. “Rights” applies to the Intellectual
      Property rights linked to the material. “Management” covers both the defining
      of policy and enforcing that policy in such a way that rights are respected.
      The ultimate goal of a distributed DRM system is for content authors to be able
      to project policies governing their content into remote environments with confidence
      that those policies will be respected by the remote nodes. For the purposes
      of this International Standard, DRM is taken to mean technology that enables
      the secure distribution (and where appropriate, sale) of digital media content
      on the Internet.'
