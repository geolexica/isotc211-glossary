  notes:
  - content: cf. passive object. An active object can represent a user, or an active
      service that depends on internal (and therefore not visible) triggers to start
      actions. Active and passive states can exist for the same object, and such a
      service can transition between these two states depending on invocation of an
      activation or deactivation operation protocol.
