            capable of initiating interactions between itself and other objects without

          notes:
          - cf. passive object. An active object can represent a user, or an active
            service that depends on internal (and therefore not visible) triggers
            to start actions. Active and passive states can exist for the same object,
            and such a service can transition between these two states depending on
            invocation of an activation or deactivation operation protocol.
