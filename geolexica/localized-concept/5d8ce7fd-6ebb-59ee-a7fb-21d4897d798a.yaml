  definition:
  - content: set of topological primitives of higher topological dimension associated
      with a particular topological object, such that this topological object is in
      each of their boundaries
  examples: []
  id: '48'
  notes:
  - content: If a node is on the boundary of an edge, that edge is on the coboundary
      of that node. Any orientation parameter associated to one of these relations
      would also be associated to the other. So that if the node is the end node of
      the edge (defined as the end of the positive directed edge), then the positive
      orientation of the node (defined as the positive directed node) would have the
      edge on its coboundary, see ISO 19107 Figure 35.
