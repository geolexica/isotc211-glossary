  notes:
  - content: '`[AA a in A => min(A) <= a] => [AA b in [(b in [AA a in A => b <=a]
      => [min(A) >= b]]` Any number is a lower bound of `O/` considered as a set of
      numbers, because any given number is less than any number in `O/` (an admitted
      vacuous statement since there is no number in `O/`, but true nonetheless). This
      means that the `min(O/)` must be greater than any number; this `+oo`.'
