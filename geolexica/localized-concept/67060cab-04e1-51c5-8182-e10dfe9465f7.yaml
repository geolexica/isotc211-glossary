            [min(A) >= b]]` Any number is a lower bound of `O/` considered as a set
            of numbers, because any given number is less than any number in `O/` (an
            admitted vacuous statement since there is no number in `O/`, but true
            nonetheless). This means that the `min(O/)` must be greater than any number;
            this `+oo`.'
