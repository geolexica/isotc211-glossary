  - content: The feature concept "road" may be used to specify several different feature
      types, each with a different set of properties appropriate for a particular
      application.  For a travel planning application, it might have a limited set
      of attributes such as name, route number, location and number of lanes, while
      for a maintenance application it might have an extensive set of attributes detailing
      the structure and composition of each of the layers of material for which it
      is composed.
