  notes:
  - content: An interface specifies a contract; any classifier that realizes the interface
      must fulfil that contract. The obligations that can be associated with an interface
      are in the form of various kinds of constraints (such as pre- and post-conditions)
      or protocol specifications, which can impose ordering restrictions on interactions
      through the interface.
