          notes:
          - Unlike the addressee, the mailee is always specified explicitly in a postal
            address, i.e. if a postal address does not contain a mailee, then there
            is no mailee.
          - Notwithstanding Note 1 to entry, the mailee may be designated explicitly
            by use of a role descriptor or designated implicitly with no role descriptor.
          - As is the case for addressee, a mailee specified in a postal address might
            be ambiguous.
