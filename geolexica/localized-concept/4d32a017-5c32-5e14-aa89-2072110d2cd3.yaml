  notes:
  - content: The free variables mentioned above can usually be thought of as a local
      coordinate system. In a 3D coordinate space, a plane can be written as P(u,
      v) = A + u X + v Y, where u and v are real numbers and A is any point on the
      plane, and X and Y are two vectors tangent to the plane. Since the locations
      on the plane can be distinguished by u and v (here universally), the plane is
      2D and (u, v) is a coordinate system for the points on the plane. On generic
      surfaces, this cannot, in general, be done universally. If we take a plane tangent
      to the surface, and project points on the surface onto this plane, we will normally
      get a local  isomorphism for small neighbourhoods of the point of tangency.
      This "local coordinate" system for the underlying surface is sufficient to establish
      the surface as a 2D topological object. Since this International Standard deals
      only with spatial coordinates, any 3D object can rely on coordinates to establish
      its topological dimension. In a 4D model (spatio-temporal), tangent spaces also
      play an important role in establishing topological dimension for objects up
      to 3D.
