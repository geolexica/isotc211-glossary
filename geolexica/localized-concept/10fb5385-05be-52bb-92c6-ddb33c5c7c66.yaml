  notes:
  - content: Temporal sequences are not assumed to be evenly spaced in time, nor equidistance
      in space. For discrete change, the default logic is to sample at temporal points
      of change if possible, so that the timestamp is the first temporal instance
      where the attributes listed have taken on that combination of values. For sake
      of space savings, some samples in a sequence only list those values that have
      changed since the immediately preceding temporal sample. For this reason, a
      sample should only be considered in the context of its containing sequence.
      For rigid motions (such as vehicle tracking), only centroid (a point value)
      and orientation (direction of travel) are needed for a temporal sequence describing
      location and spatial extent. A motion in combination with an object deformation
      would require more information.
