      of polarization

  notes:
  - content: By combining multiple polarization modes, it is possible to characterize
      the target more clearly. Quad-Pol SAR system both transmits and receives orthogonal
      (e.g. horizontal and vertical) polarizations, which creates four polarizations
      of a single imaging scene. The calibration of Quad-Pol SAR is addressed in this
      document.
