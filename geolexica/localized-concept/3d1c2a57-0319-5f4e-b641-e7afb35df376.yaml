  notes:
  - content: Since the definitions of geometric complex and topological complex require
      only that they be closed under boundary operations, the set of any primitives
      of a particular dimension and below is always a subcomplex of the original,
      larger complex. Thus, any full planar topological complex contains an edge-node
      graph as a subcomplex.
