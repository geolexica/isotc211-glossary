  definition:
  - content: storage mechanism for multidimensional array in linear memory, organized
      such that each row is stored in consecutive locations and such that the complete
      rows are the stored one after the other and continuing on is a similar fashion
      of each additional index

  notes:
  - content: 'If the indexes are `(i, j)` with the number of rows `r` and columns
      `c`, then the mapping between the multidimensional locations to the linear storage
      locations is given by: \[[i,j \in \mathbb{Z} \backepsilon 1 \leq i \leq r; 1
      \leq j \leq c] \implies [(i,j) \rightarrow (i-1)c + j]\] \[[i,j,k \in \mathbb{Z}
      \backepsilon 1 \leq i \leq r; 1 \leq j \leq c; 1 \leq k \leq f] \implies [(i,j,k)
      \rightarrow ((i-1)c + j -1)f + k]\]'
  - content: 'The matrix `[[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]` in row major form is stored as
      `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`. For higher dimensions, the same pattern is applied
      recursively:'
