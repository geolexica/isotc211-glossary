  definition:
  - content: plane curve segment containing the normal at one of its terminal points
  examples: []
  id: '2078'
  notes:
  - content: The usual construction begins by choosing one of the end points, the
      normal to the surface at that end point, and the location of the other end point
      and creating a plane in latexmath:[\mathbb{E}^3], which is then intersected
      with the datum. This curve is a normal section curve between these two points,
      containing the normal to the surface at the first point. On the sphere, this
      is the geodesic, and the two normal section curves are equal. On an ellipsoidal
      datum, the same is true for two points on the equator, or two points on the
      same meridian plane, but false in general. The reason is that in these cases
      the plane through the two points and the centre of the ellipsoid are planes
      of symmetry for the ellipsoid dividing the ellipsoid into symmetric "mirror"
      image halves. In general, the geodesic between the two points lies between the
      two normal section curves.
