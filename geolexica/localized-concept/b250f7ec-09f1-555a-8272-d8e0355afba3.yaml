  definition:
  - content: largest number n such that each point in a set of points can be associated
      with a subset that has that point in its interior and is topologically isomorphic
      to ùîºn, Euclidean n-space

  notes:
  - content: Curves, because they are continuous images of a portion of the real line,
      have geometric dimension 1. Surfaces cannot always be mapped to `RR^2` in their
      entirety, but around each point position, a small neighborhood can be found
      that resembles (under continuous functions) the interior of the unit circle
      in `RR^2`, and are therefore 2-dimensional. In this document, most surfaces
      (instances of Surface) are mapped to portions of `RR^2` by their defining interpolation
      mechanisms.
