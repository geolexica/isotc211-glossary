  notes:
  - content: The phrase "absolute accuracy" is sometimes used for this concept to
      distinguish it from relative positional accuracy.  Where the true coordinate
      value may not be perfectly known, accuracy is normally tested by comparison
      to available values that can best be accepted as true.
