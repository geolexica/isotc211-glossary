  notes:
  - content: The concept of "measurement error" can be used both a) when there is
      a single reference quantity value to refer to, which occurs if a calibration
      is made by means of a measurement standard with a measured quantity value having
      a negligible measurement uncertainty or if a conventional quantity value is
      given, in which case the measurement error is known, and b) if a measurand is
      supposed to be represented by a unique true quantity value or a set of true
      quantity values of negligible range, in which case the measurement error is
      not known.
  - content: Measurement error should not be confused with production error or mistake.
