  notes:
  - content: The boundary of a curve is the set of points at either end of the curve.
      If the curve is a cycle, the two ends are identical, and the curve (if topologically
      closed) is considered to not have a boundary. The first point is called the
      start point, and the last is the end point. Connectivity of the curve is guaranteed
      by the "continuous image of a line" clause. A topological theorem states that
      a continuous image of a connected set is connected.
