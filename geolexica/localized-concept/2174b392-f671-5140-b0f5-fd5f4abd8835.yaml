          - If a node is on the boundary of an edge, that edge is on the coboundary
            of that node. Any orientation parameter associated to one of these relations
            would also be associated to the other. So that if the node is the end
            node of the edge (defined as the end of the positive directed edge), then
            the positive orientation of the node (defined as the positive directed
            node) would have the edge on its coboundary, see ISO 19107 Figure 35.
