  definition:
  - content: sum total of all mitigating factors with respect to a particular licensee
      that reduces expected risk

  notes:
  - content: Trust allows the owner [or his agent] to act with a higher potential
      risk because the expected risk has been lowered. This is slightly different
      from the plain language of trust. Normally, trust requires something, but if
      the principal at risk decides that no risk exists, then trust exists (in the
      sense here) because risk has been reduced, whatever the reason.
