  notes:
  - content: A chain of agency, with the proper agreements at each step creates a
      transitive agency between the agent of the first link and the principal of the
      last. This chain can be spoken of in either direction, either as “principal
      -> agent = principal -> agent” (normal or granting order) or “agent -> principal
      = agent -> principal” (reverse, acceptance, verification or tracing order).
