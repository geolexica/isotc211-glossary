  notes:
  - content: The spectral responsivity is the response of the sensor with respect
      to the wavelengths dependent radiance.
  - content: The definition is described mathematically in IEC 60050-845. The spectral
      responsivity is quotient of the detector output dY(λ) by the monochromatic detector
      input dXe(λ) = Xe, λ(λ) • dλ in the wavelength interval dλ as a function of
      the wavelength λ  s(λ) = dY(λ) / dXc(λ)
