  definition:
  - content: problem that given a point on a surface and the direction and distance
      from that point to a second point along a geodesic, determines that second point

  notes:
  - content: This "problem" defines a mapping from the vector space at a point (each
      vector given by a direction and a length) to points of the Figure of Earth that
      satisfy the problem for that direction and distance. For example, if we fix
      the distance "r" and take all directions, the resultant geometry is the circle
      centred at the original point of radius "r". This document will make heavy use
      of this mapping; see exponential map and the second geodetic problem.
