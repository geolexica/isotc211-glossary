  definition:
  - content: 2-dimensional geometric primitive, locally representing a continuous
      image of a region of a plane
  examples: []
  id: '437'
  notes:
  - content: The boundary of a surface is the set of oriented, closed curves that
      delineate the limits of the surface. Surfaces that are isomorphic to a sphere,
      or to an stem:[n]-torus (a topological sphere with stem:[n] "handles") have
      no boundary. Such surfaces are called cycles.
