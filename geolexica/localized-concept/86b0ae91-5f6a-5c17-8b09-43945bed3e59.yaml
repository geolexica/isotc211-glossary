  definition:
  - content: system consisting of 1) a photon source (frequently, but not necessarily,
      a laser), 2) a photon detection system, 3) a timing circuit, and 4) optics for
      both the source and the receiver that uses emitted laser light to measure ranges
      to and/or properties of solid objects, gases, or particulates in the atmosphere
  examples: []
  id: '1676'
  notes:
  - content: Time of flight (TOF) LIDARs use short laser pulses and precisely record
      the time each laser pulse was emitted and the time each reflected return(s)
      is received in order to calculate the distance(s) to the scatterer(s) encountered
      by the emitted pulse. For topographic LIDAR, these time-of-flight measurements
      are then combined with precise platform location/attitude data along with pointing
      data to produce a three-dimensional product of the illuminated scene of interest.
