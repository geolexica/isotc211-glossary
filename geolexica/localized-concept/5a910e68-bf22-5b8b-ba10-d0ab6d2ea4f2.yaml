          definition: geometric set in which any direct position on the straight-line
            segment joining any two direct positions in the geometric set is also
            contained in the geometric set

          notes:
          - Convex sets are "simply connected", meaning that they have no interior
            holes, and can normally be considered topologically isomorphic to a Euclidean
            ball of the appropriate dimension. So the surface of a sphere can be considered
            to be geodesically convex.
