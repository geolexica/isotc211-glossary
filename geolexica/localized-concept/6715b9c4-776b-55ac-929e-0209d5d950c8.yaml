  definition:
  - content: service providing a basic function to other services or applications
      in a functional manner
  examples: []

  language_code: eng
  notes:
  - content: cf. interoperate. Basic services lack any persistent, user-specific state
      information between invocations and are not meant for direct access by users.
      Because they act in a functional manner, they are readily replaceable at runtime
      by other services using the same interfaces.
