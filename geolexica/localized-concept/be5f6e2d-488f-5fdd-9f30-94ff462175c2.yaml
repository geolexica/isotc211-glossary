  notes:
  - content: Homomorphisms are distinct from isomorphisms in that no inverse function
      is required. In an isomorphism, there are essentially two homomorphisms that
      are functional inverses of one another. Continuous functions are topological
      homomorphisms because they preserve "topological characteristics." The mapping
      of topological complexes to their geometric realizations preserves the concept
      of boundary and is therefore a homomorphism.
