          notes:
          - Boundary face strings are used to represent the boundaries of spatial
            units by means of line strings in 2D. This 2D representation is a 2D boundary
            in a 2D land administration system. In a 3D land administration system
            it represents a series of vertical boundary faces  where an unbounded
            volume is assumed, surrounded by boundary faces which intersect the Earth’s
            surface (such as traditionally depicted in the cadastral map).
