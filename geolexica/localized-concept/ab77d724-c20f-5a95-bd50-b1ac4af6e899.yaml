          notes:
          - Measurements acquired in the field are affected by many instrumental and
            environmental factors, including meteorological conditions, computational
            methods and constraints, imperfect instrument construction, incomplete
            instrument adjustment or calibration, and, in the case of optical measuring
            systems, the personal bias of the observer.  Solutions for positions may
            be affected by the geometric relationships of the observed data and/or
            mathematical model employed in the processing software.
