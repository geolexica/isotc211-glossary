  notes:
  - content: The usual construction begins by choosing one of the end points, the
      normal to the surface at that end point, and the location of the other end point
      and creating a plane in ùîº3, which is then intersected with the datum. This curve
      is a normal section curve between these two points, containing the normal to
      the surface at the first point. On the sphere, this is the geodesic, and the
      two normal section curves are equal. On an ellipsoidal datum, the same is true
      for two points on the equator, or two points on the same meridian plane, but
      false in general. The reason is that in these cases the plane through the two
      points and the centre of the ellipsoid are planes of symmetry for the ellipsoid
      dividing the ellipsoid into symmetric "mirror" image halves. In general, the
      geodesic between the two points lies between the two normal section curves.in
