  definition: []
  examples:
  - content: A condominium unit comprising two spatial units (e.g. an apartment and
      a garage), a farm lot comprising one spatial unit (e.g. parcel of land), a servitude
      comprising one spatial unit (e.g. the road representing the right-of-way), a

  id: '1570'
  notes:
  - content: "'Unique' means that a right, restriction, or responsibility is held
      by one or more parties (e.g. owners or users) for the whole basic administrative
      unit. 'Homogeneous' means that a right, restriction or responsibility (e.g.
      ownership, use, social tenure, lease, or easement) affects the whole basic administrative
      unit. For a restriction, zero parties are a possibility."
  - content: A basic administrative unit may play the role of party, e.g. when the
      right holder is a basic administrative unit (and not a person or organization).
  - content: A baunit should get a unique identifier when registered, or recorded.
  - content: A baunit can consist of zero spatial units, when a registry exists, and
      not a cadastre.
  - content: Restrictions and responsibilities can be associated with their own baunits,
      each with their own type of spatial unit.
