          notes:
          - The normal curvature vector of a curve is dependent only on the curve
            and the surface (which is a constraint on the curve). The normal curvature
            vector of a curve restricted to a surface is parallel to the normal vector
            of the surface. If the normal curvature vector is equal to the curvature
            vector of the curve everywhere, then the curve is a geodesic.
