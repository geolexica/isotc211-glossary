          notes:
          - If `c(s) = (x(s), y(s), z(s))` is a curve in a 3D Cartesian space (`bbb"E"^3`),
            and `s` is arc length along `c`, then the tangent is `vec tau(s) = dot
            c(s) = (dot x(s), dot y(s), dot z(s))`, i.e. the derivative of the coordinate
            values of `c` with respect to `s`. The curvature vector is `kappa(s) =
            ddot c(s) = (ddot x(s), ddot y(s), ddot z(s))`.
