      The definition can be rewritten as "the intersection of all convex sets that
      contain the geometric object". Another definition in a Euclidean space `bbb"E"^n`
      is the union of all lines with both end points in the given geometric object.
      `C = A."convexHull" <=> [C."convex" = "TRUE"] ^^ [A sub C] ^^ [[B."convex" =
      "true", A sub B] => [A sube C sube B]]`'
