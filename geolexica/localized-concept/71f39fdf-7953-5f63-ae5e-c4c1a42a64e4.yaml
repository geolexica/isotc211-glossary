          notes:
          - The addressee may be explicitly defined as part of the postal address,
            or may be implicit. For example, in certain countries, omission of addressee
            information is taken as implying that delivery is to be to an individual
            or legal entity having legal access to the delivery point.
          - Mr. or Mrs. Smith specifies that the addressee is either of two individuals,
            while Mr. Jones and Mrs. Smith denote that the addressee is a group of
            two individuals. See also role descriptor.
          - The use made by the postal operator of addressee and mailee data might
            be dependent on the postal service applicable to the postal item. For
            some services, such as registered mail, the postal operator’s responsibility
            might include ensuring that the addressee or a duly authorized representative
            acknowledges receipt of the postal item. In other cases, addressee data
            could be purely informative or used by the postal operator only for consistency
            checking and/or for the activation of forwarding services. In other cases,
            it might be used for sorting or sequencing purposes prior to delivery,
            e.g. in the case of business mail being pre-sequenced by department or
            individual company official.
          - In some countries, the addressee may be an abstraction such as “postal
            customer”.
