          definition: set of spatial units, with a geometric, and/or topologic, and/or

          entry_status: valid
          examples:
          - One level of spatial units for an urban cadastre and another for spatial
            units for a rural cadastre.
          - One level of spatial units to define basic administrative units associated
            with rights and another level of spatial units to define basic administrative
            units associated with restrictions.
          - One level of spatial units to define basic administrative units associated
            with formal rights, a second level for spatial units to define basic administrative
            units associated with informal rights and a third level for spatial units
            to define basic administrative units associated with customary rights.
          - One level with point based spatial units, a second level with line based
            spatial units, and a third level with polygon based spatial units.
