  notes:
  - content: Directed solids are used in the coboundary relation to maintain the spatial
      association between face and topological solid. The orientation of a solid is
      with respect to a face, "+" if the upNormal is outward, "-" if inward. This
      is consistent with the concept of "up = outward" for a surface bounding a solid.
