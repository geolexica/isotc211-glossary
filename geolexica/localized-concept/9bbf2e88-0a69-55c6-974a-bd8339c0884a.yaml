          notes:
          - In this context, satellite positioning implies the use of radio signals
            transmitted from "active" artificial objects orbiting the Earth and received
            by "passive" instruments on or near the Earth's surface to determine position,
            velocity, and/or attitude of an object.  Examples are GPS and GLONASS.
