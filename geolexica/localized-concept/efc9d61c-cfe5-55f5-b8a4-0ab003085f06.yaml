          - A data quality result of "90" with a data quality value type of "percentage"
            reported for the data quality element and its data quality subelement
            "completeness, commission" is an example of a value resulting from applying
            a data quality measure to the data specified by a data quality scope.  A

            variable" is an example of comparing the value (90) against a specified
            acceptable conformance quality level (85) and reporting an evaluation
            of a kind, pass or fail.
