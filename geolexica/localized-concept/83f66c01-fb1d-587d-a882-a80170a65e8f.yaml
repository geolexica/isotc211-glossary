            refers to the material over which the rights exist. “Rights” applies to
            the Intellectual Property rights linked to the material. “Management”
            covers both the defining of policy and enforcing that policy in such a
            way that rights are respected. The ultimate goal of a distributed DRM
            system is for content authors to be able to project policies governing
            their content into remote environments with confidence that those policies
            will be respected by the remote nodes. For the purposes of this International
            Standard, DRM is taken to mean technology that enables the secure distribution
            (and where appropriate, sale) of digital media content on the Internet.'
