  definition:
  - content: smallest element larger than or equal to all elements of a set contained
      in an ordered domain (stem:[<=])
  examples: []
  id: '2071'
  notes:
  - content: stem:[[AA a in A => max(A) >= a] => [AA b notin [(b notin [AA a in A
      => b >= a] => [max(a) <= b]]]]] Any number is an upper bound of stem:[O/] (empty
      set) as a set of numbers, because any given number is greater than any number
      in stem:[O/] (an admitted vacuous statement since there is no number in stem:[O/],
      but true nonetheless). This means that the stem:[max(O/)] must be smaller than
      any number; thus stem:[-oo].
