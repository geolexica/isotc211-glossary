  notes:
  - content: Boundary face strings are used to represent the boundaries of spatial
      units by means of line strings in 2D. This 2D representation is a 2D boundary
      in a 2D land administration system. In a 3D land administration system it represents
      a series of vertical boundary faces  where an unbounded volume is assumed, surrounded
      by boundary faces which intersect the Earth’s surface (such as traditionally
      depicted in the cadastral map).
