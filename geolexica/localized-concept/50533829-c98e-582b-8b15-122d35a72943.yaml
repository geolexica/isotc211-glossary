  notes:
  - content: A class or data element definition instantiates a type if it creates
      the ability to create objects or data elements respectively, that can represent
      the concepts (instance data and /or operations) defined by that type. A class
      is instantiated by an object if the class defines that object's structure and
      function. A data schema is instantiated by a data element if the data schema
      defines that element's structure.
