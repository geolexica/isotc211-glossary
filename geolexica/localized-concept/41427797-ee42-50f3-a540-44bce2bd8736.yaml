          - This definition (as opposed to the one in ISO 19162:2015) is required
            for this document  because the concept is used in other definitions, such
            as first geodetic problem and second geodetic problem. The two definitions
            are nearly equivalent because the tangent of a curve on a surface is a
            tangent to the surface and does specify a direction. Usual 2D measure
            of bearing can be an angle equivalently measured from North clockwise,
            or a unit tangent vector. If the coordinate system is spatially 3D, the
            horizontal bearing angle may also need to a vertical altitude angle to
            be complete. If a reference curve (as used in ISO 19162) is parameterized
            by arc length, then the "derivative" is a unit vector. If another parameterization
            `t` is used, then the derivative should be normalized (`vec tau / (norm
            (vec tau)); dot c(t) = vec tau;`). This is useful, since parameterization
            by arc length can be computationally difficult. The numeric representation
            of a vector depends on the coordinate system. The bearing is not dependent
            on a coordinate system, but it can be represented in any reasonable system.
            The bearing is not dependent on its various representations.
