          notes:
          - A metrological traceability chain is defined through a calibration hierarchy.
          - A metrological traceability chain is used to establish metrological traceability
            of a measurement result.
          - A comparison between two measurement standards may be viewed as a calibration
            if the comparison is used to check and, if necessary, correct the quantity
            value and measurement uncertainty attributed to one of the measurement
            standards.
