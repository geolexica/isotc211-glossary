  definition:
  - content: datum describing the relation of gravity-related heights or depths to
      the Earth
  examples: []

  notes:
  - content: In most cases, the vertical datum will be related to mean sea level.
      Ellipsoidal heights are treated as related to a three-dimensional ellipsoidal
      coordinate system referenced to a geodetic datum. Vertical datums include sounding
      datums (used for hydrographic purposes), in which case the heights may be negative
      heights or depths.
