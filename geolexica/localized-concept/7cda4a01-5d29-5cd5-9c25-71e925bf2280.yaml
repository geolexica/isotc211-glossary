  - content: physical temperature of correctional impedance that delivers to the receiver
      the same noise power as the antenna collects

  notes:
  - content: |-
      This includes two terms: the noise coming from the environment attenuated by the antenna Ohmic efficiency and the thermal noise added by the antenna Ohmic losses. In the Rayleigh-Jeans approximation, the following formula applies:stem:[T_("A ", "out") (Omega_(0)) = eta_(Omega) T_("A") (Omega_(0)) + (1 âˆ’ eta_(Omega)) T_("p")]

      where

      stem:[T_"A"] is the antenna apeture temperature;
      stem:[T_"p"] is the physical temperature of the antenna;
      stem:[Omega_0] is the Ohmic loss;
      stem:[eta_Omega] is the Ohmic efficiency of the antenna.
  - content: "The antenna output temperature (stem:[T_{A,out}]) is related to the
      input noise temperature of the receiver as shown in the following formula: stem:[T_{\"rec\",\"in\"}
      = (\"h\" nu) / (\"e\"^{\"h\" nu // \"k\" T_{A,\"out\"}} - 1)]\n\nwhere\n\nstem:[T_{\"rec\",\"in\"}]
      is the input noise temperature of the receiver;\nstem:[\"h\"] is the Plank's
      constant (stem:[6.62607 xx 10^{-34} \"J\" cdot \"s\"]); \nstem:[nu] is the frequency
      in Hz;\nstem:[\"k\"] is the Boltzmann's constant (stem:[1.38064852 xx 10^{-23}
      \"J\"//\"K\"]);\nstem:[\"e\"] is the base of natural logarithm."
