          notes:
          - Postal address template may need to include rendition instructions.
          - A template specifies also constraints for syntactical correctness of postal
            addresses by indicating which elements are mandatory and which are optional.
          - Software that interprets the rendering rules provided in template is needed
            to produce rendered addresses.
          - Postal address templates are further described in Clause 8.
          - For convenience, the preferred term “postal address template” has been
            shortened to the admitted term “template” throughout this document.
