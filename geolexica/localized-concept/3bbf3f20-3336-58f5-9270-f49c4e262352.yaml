          definition: distance of a point from the reference ellipsoid along the perpendicular

          notes:
          - Only used as part of a three-dimensional ellipsoidal coordinate system
            or as part of a three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system in a three-dimensional
            projected coordinate reference system, but never on its own.
