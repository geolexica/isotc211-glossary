  notes:
  - content: stem:[P = (p_i), Q = (q_i), "distance"(P,Q) = sqrt( sum_{i=1}^n (p_i
      - q_i)^2)]. The proofs of the Pythagorean metrics all depend on the local "flatness"
      of the space. Cartesian coordinate space which have Pythagorean metrics are
      called Euclidean spaces (stem:[bbb"E"^n]). In the realm of coordinate reference
      systems, only "Engineering Coordinate Systems" are Euclidean. Any CRS using
      a curved Datum are by definition non-Euclidean, and cannot "truthfully" use
      Pythagorean metrics except for approximation. These approximations are valid
      for topological statements, but not for real world measures without adjustments.
