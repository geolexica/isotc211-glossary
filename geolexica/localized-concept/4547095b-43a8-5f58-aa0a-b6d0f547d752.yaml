  definition:
  - content: party designated in a postal address as having responsibility for ensuring
      that postal items reach their addressee
  examples: []
  id: '2116'
  notes:
  - content: Unlike the addressee, the mailee is always specified explicitly in a
      postal address, i.e. if a postal address does not contain a mailee, then there
      is no mailee.
  - content: Notwithstanding Note 1 to entry, the mailee may be designated explicitly
      by use of a role descriptor or designated implicitly with no role descriptor.
  - content: As is the case for addressee, a mailee specified in a postal address
      might be ambiguous.
