          notes:
          - The class Any in some programming languages is the abstract root of all
            classes. Thus, it is the de facto union of all classes. In this document,
            Geometry is the (named and explicit) abstract root for all geometry objects.
            In the package Geometry and any of its subpackages (including those in
            its Requirements Classes), any interface will be a subtype of Geometry
            either directly or transitively.
