  - content: coordinate reference system derived from a geographic coordinate reference
      system by applying a map projection
  examples: []
  id: '2317'
  notes:
  - content: May be two- or three-dimensional, the dimension being equal to that of
      the geographic coordinate reference system from which it is derived.
  - content: In the three-dimensional case the horizontal coordinates (geodetic latitude
      and geodetic longitude coordinates) are projected to northing and easting and
      the ellipsoidal height is unchanged.
