          notes:
          - The abstract concept of a TRS is realised through a terrestrial reference
            frame that usually consists of a set of physical points with precisely
            determined coordinates and optionally their rates of change. In this document
            terrestrial reference frame is included within the geodetic reference
            frame element of the data model.
