          definition: set of conventions defining the origin, scale, orientation and
            time evolution of a spatial reference system co-rotating with the Earth
            in its diurnal motion in space

          notes:
          - The abstract concept of a TRS is realised through a terrestrial reference
            frame that usually consists of a set of physical points with precisely
            determined coordinates and optionally their rates of change. In this document
            terrestrial reference frame is included within the geodetic reference
            frame element of the data model.
