          definition: manipulation of and calculations with geometric representations
            for the implementation of geometric operations
          entry_status: retired
          examples:
          - Computational geometry operations include testing for geometric inclusion
            or intersection, the calculation of convex hulls or buffer zones, or the
            finding of shortest distances between geometric objects.
