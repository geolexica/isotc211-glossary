          definition: geometric complex where the geometric primitives are in a 1-to-1
            correspondence to the topological primitives of a topological complex,
            such that the boundary relations in the two complexes agree

          notes:
          - In such a realization, the topological primitives are considered to represent
            the interiors of the corresponding geometric primitives even though the
            primitives themselves are closed.
