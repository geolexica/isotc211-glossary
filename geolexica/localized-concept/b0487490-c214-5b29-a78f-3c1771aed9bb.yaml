          - \[[\forall a \in A \implies min(A) \leq a] \implies [\forall b \ni [(b
            \ni [\forall a \in A \implies b \leq a] \implies [min(A) \geq b]]\] Any
            number is a lower bound of `O/` considered as a set of numbers, because
            any given number is less than any number in `O/` (an admitted vacuous
            statement since there is no number in `O/`, but true nonetheless). This
            means that the `min(O/)` must be greater than any number; this `+oo`.
