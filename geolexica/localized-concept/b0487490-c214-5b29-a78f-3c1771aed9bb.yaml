  - content: \[[\forall a \in A \implies min(A) \leq a] \implies [\forall b \ni [(b
      \ni [\forall a \in A \implies b \leq a] \implies [min(A) \geq b]]\] Any number
      is a lower bound of `O/` considered as a set of numbers, because any given number
      is less than any number in `O/` (an admitted vacuous statement since there is
      no number in `O/`, but true nonetheless). This means that the `min(O/)` must
      be greater than any number; this `+oo`.
