          notes:
          - Taken from FAO LCCS version 2 (see Reference [2] in ISO 19144-1)
          - The approach is based upon definition of classes before any data collection
            actually takes place
          - See Annex B [of ISO 19144-1] for an examination of this and a posteriori
            classification
