  - content: adjustment of the relationship between the input signal and the output
      response of a radiometer using two distinct input stimuli
  examples: []

  notes:
  - content: Assuming a linear receiver, all possible input signal levels can now
      be retrieved from the radiometer output responses.
  - content: In the case of an external end-to-end calibration, the input signal equals
      the antenna temperature of the radiometer.
