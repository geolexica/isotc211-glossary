  - content: data sufficient to identify an object over time, independent of its state
  examples: []
  id: '667'
  notes:
  - content: An identity is usually a persistent and constant key member attribute
      value of the object. Since it is temporally constant and unique, it will be
      the same in any state associated to the object regardless of its timestamp.
      A moving object's identity is independent of both time and location.
