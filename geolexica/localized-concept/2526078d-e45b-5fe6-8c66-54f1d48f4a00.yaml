  notes:
  - content: 'If the radar return from the illuminated area is contributed by a number
      of independent scattering elements, it is described by the backscattering coefficient
      instead of radar cross section used for the point target. It is calculated as
      `sigma^0 = sigma/A` Where `sigma` is the total radar cross section of an area
      `A`. `sigma^0` is a dimesionless parameter and is usually expressed in decibels
      (dB) as follows: `sigma_(dB)^0 = 10 log_(10) sigma^0`'
  - content: “Backscattering coefficient” is sometimes called “normalized radar cross
      section”.
