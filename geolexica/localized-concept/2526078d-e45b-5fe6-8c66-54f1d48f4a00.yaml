          notes:
          - 'If the radar return from the illuminated area is contributed by a number
            of independent scattering elements, it is described by the backscattering
            coefficient instead of radar cross section used for the point target.
            It is calculated as `sigma^0 = sigma/A` Where `sigma` is the total radar
            cross section of an area `A`. `sigma^0` is a dimesionless parameter and
            is usually expressed in decibels (dB) as follows: `sigma_(dB)^0 = 10 log_(10)
            sigma^0`'
          - “Backscattering coefficient” is sometimes called “normalized radar cross
            section”.
