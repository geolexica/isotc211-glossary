          definition: ratio between the peak power of the largest side lobe and the
            peak power of the main lobe of the impulse response of point targets in
            the SAR image

          notes:
          - The peak side lobe ratio is usually expressed in decibels (dB) and computed
            as follows `PSLR = 10log_(10) {(P_(text(sidepeak)))/(P_(text(mainpeak)))}`
            where `P_(text(mainpeak))` is the peak power of the main lobe; `P_(text(sidepeak))`
            is the peak power of the largest side lobe.
