  definition:
  - content: coordinate operation that changes coordinates in a source coordinate
      reference system to coordinates in a target coordinate reference system in which
      the source and target coordinate reference systems are based on different datums
  examples: []
  id: '2354'
  notes:
  - content: A coordinate transformation uses parameters which are derived empirically.
      Any error in those coordinates will be embedded in the coordinate transformation
      and when the coordinate transformation is applied the embedded errors are transmitted
      to output coordinates.
  - content: A coordinate transformation is colloquially sometimes referred to as
      a 'datum transformation'. This is erroneous. A coordinate transformation changes
      coordinate values. It does not change the definition of the datum. In this document
      coordinates are referenced to a coordinate reference system. A coordinate transformation
      operates between two coordinate reference systems, not between two datums.
