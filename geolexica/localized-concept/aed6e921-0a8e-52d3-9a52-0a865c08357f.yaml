      uniformly in all directions

      In order to use CMB for calibrating a microwave radiometer operating at microwave to submillimetre band, it should be converted into brightness temperature, stem:[T_"B"], according to the following formula:stem:[T_"B" = ("h"nu(e^(("h"nu)/("k"T_"c"))+1))/(2"k"(e^(("h"nu)/("k"T_"c"))-1))]

      where

      stem:["h"] is the Planck’s constant (stem:[6.62607xx10^(-34) "J" cdot "s"]);
      stem:[v] is the frequency in Hz;
      stem:["k"] is the Boltzmann’s constant (stem:[1.38064852xx10^(-23) "J"//"K"]);
      stem:[T_"c"] is the cosmic background temperature (stem:[2.736 pm 0.017 "K"]);
      stem:["e"] is the base of natural logarithm
