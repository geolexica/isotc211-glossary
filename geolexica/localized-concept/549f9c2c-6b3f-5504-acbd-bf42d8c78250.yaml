  definition:
  - content: smallest convex set containing a given geometric object
  examples: []
  id: '86'
  notes:
  - content: '"Smallest" is the set theoretic smallest, not an indication of a measurement.
      The definition can be rewritten as "the intersection of all convex sets that
      contain the geometric object". Another definition in a Euclidean space stem:[bbb"E"^n]
      is the union of all lines with both end points in the given geometric object.
      stem:[C = A."convexHull" <=> [C."convex" = "TRUE"] ^^ [A sub C] ^^ [[B."convex"
      = "true", A sub B] => [A sube C sube B]]]'
