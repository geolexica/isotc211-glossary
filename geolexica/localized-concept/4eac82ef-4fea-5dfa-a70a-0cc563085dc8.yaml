      For the frequency range of microwave, Planck's radiation law can be well approximated by the Rayleigh-Jeans formula. Usually the microwave radiometers use the Rayleigh–Jeans equivalent brightness temperature, which is defined as: stem:[T_("b,v")^("(RJE)")=c^2/(2v^2"k")I_"v"]

      where

      stem:[T_("b,v")^("(RJE)") is the Rayleigh–Jeans equivalent brightness temperature;
      stem:[v] is the frequency in Hz;
      stem:["c"] is the velocity of light (stem:[2.997925xx10^8 "m"//"s"]);
      stem:["k"] is the Boltzmann’s constant (stem:[1.38064852xx10^(-23) "J"//"K"]);
      stem:[I_"v"] is the radiance.
