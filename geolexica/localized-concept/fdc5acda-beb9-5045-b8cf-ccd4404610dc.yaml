  notes:
  - content: 'Parts with non-fixed multiplicity may be created after the composite
      itself, but once created they live and die with it (i.e., they share lifetimes).
      Such parts can also be explicitly removed before the death of the composite.
      Composition may be recursive. Synonym: composite aggregation.'
