  notes:
  - content: Point and DirectPosition are informationally identical (related to each
      other in a one to one fashion) in this context. Given a DirectPosition, a Point
      can be constructed. Given a Point, a DirectPosition can be derived from of its
      coordinates. If coercion is supported, a Point may be used where a DirectPosition
      is requested, and vice versa. Most programming languages use coercion, but others
      use "cast" operators (a type of constructor) requiring the programmer to initiate
      the coercion. "Strong substantiality" is related in that a subtype instance
      can always be coerced to any of its supertypes.
