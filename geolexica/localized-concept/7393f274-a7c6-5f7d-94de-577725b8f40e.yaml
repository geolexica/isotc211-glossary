            location or to be sensed by external objects of known location

          notes:
          - The most common tracking devices are cell phones, GNSS chips, RFID (Radio
            Frequency ID) tags, or printed tags which are scanable by optical sensors  such
            as "bar codes".
          - The common usage of  "vehicle" means a "form of conveyance" or, more simply
            "thing that conveys (carries) something else".  Thus, a tracked object
            that carries a tracking device to allow it to be tracked is, by definition,
            a conveyance or vehicle for that device.  Thus, a cell phone that carries
            a GNSS device is the vehicle for that device, and the traveller carrying
            the cell phone, allowing him to be tracked, is the vehicle for the phone
            and all of its internal electronics.
