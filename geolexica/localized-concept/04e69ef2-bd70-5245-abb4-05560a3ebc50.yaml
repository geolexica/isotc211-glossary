  definition:
  - content: curve on a surface with a zero-length tangential curvature vector
  examples: []
  id: '2056'
  notes:
  - content: A geodesic's curvature vector is perpendicular the surface thus has the
      minimum curvature of any curve restricted to the surface. This is often defined
      as a minimal distance curve between two points, but this does not always suffice,
      since some points (especially on ellipsoids and spheres) are often joined by
      more than one geodesic. For example, on an ellipsoid the points with stem:[(varphi,lambda)
      = (0, 0)] and stem:[(0, 180)] are joined by four separate geodesic [2 polar
      (the shorter) and 2 equatorial]. The exponential map is only guaranteed to be
      one-to-one for a small area (depending on where the centre is and how the surface
      is curved).
