            having the same dimension as the space being partitioned

          examples:
          - Graphic examples of tessellations may be found in Figures 11, 13, 20 and

          notes:
          - A tessellation composed of congruent regular polygons or polyhedra is
            a regular tessellation. One composed of regular, but non-congruent polygons
            or polyhedra is a semi-regular tessellation. Otherwise the tessellation
            is irregular.
