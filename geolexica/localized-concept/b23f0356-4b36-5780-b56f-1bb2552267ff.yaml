          notes:
          - When the quality of accuracy or precision of measured values, such as
            coordinates, is to be characterized quantitatively, the quality parameter
            is an estimate of the uncertainty of the measurement results. Because
            accuracy is a qualitative concept, one should not use it quantitatively,
            that is associate numbers with it; numbers should be associated with measures
            of uncertainty instead.
