  definition:
  - content: horizontal angle, tangent or direction at a point
  examples: []
  id: '2238'
  notes:
  - content: This definition (as opposed to the one in ISO 19162:2015) is required
      for this document  because the concept is used in other definitions, such as
      first geodetic problem and second geodetic problem. The two definitions are
      nearly equivalent because the tangent of a curve on a surface is a tangent to
      the surface and does specify a direction. Usual 2D measure of bearing can be
      an angle equivalently measured from North clockwise, or a unit tangent vector.
      If the coordinate system is spatially 3D, the horizontal bearing angle may also
      need to a vertical altitude angle to be complete. If a reference curve (as used
      in ISO 19162) is parameterized by arc length, then the "derivative" is a unit
      vector. If another parameterization stem:[t] is used, then the derivative should
      be normalized (stem:[vec tau / (norm (vec tau)); dot c(t) = vec tau;]). This
      is useful, since parameterization by arc length can be computationally difficult.
      The numeric representation of a vector depends on the coordinate system. The
      bearing is not dependent on a coordinate system, but it can be represented in
      any reasonable system. The bearing is not dependent on its various representations.
