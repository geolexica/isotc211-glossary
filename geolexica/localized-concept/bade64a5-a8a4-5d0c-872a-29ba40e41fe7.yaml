  definition:
  - content: new type of modeling element that extends the semantics of the metamodel
  examples: []
  id: '432'
  notes:
  - content: Stereotypes must be based on certain existing types or classes in the
      metamodel. Stereotypes may extend the semantics, but not the structure of pre-existing
      types and classes. Certain stereotypes are predefined in the UML, others may
      be user defined. Stereotypes are one of three extensibility mechanisms in UML.
      The others are constraint and tagged value.
