  definition:
  - content: geometric complex whose geometric primitives are in a 1-to-1 correspondence
      to the topological primitives of a topological complex, such that the boundary
      relations in the two complexes agree
  examples: []
  id: '216'
  notes:
  - content: In such a realization the topological primitives are considered to represent
      the interiors of the corresponding geometric primitives. Composites are closed.
