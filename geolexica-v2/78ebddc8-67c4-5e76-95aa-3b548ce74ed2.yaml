  - content: |-
      for a series of stem:[n] measurements of the same measurand, the quantity, stem:[s(q_k)], characterizing the dispersion of the results and given by the formula  stem:[s(q_k)=sqrt((sum_(j=1)^n(q_j-bar(q))^2)/(n-1))]

      where

      stem:[q_k] is the result of the
      stem:[k]th measurement;
      stem:[q] is the arithmetic mean of the stem:[n] results considered;
      stem:[n] is the number of the measurements

  notes:
  - content: Considering the series of stem:[n] values as a sample of a distribution,
      stem:[bar q] is an unbiased estimate of the mean stem:[mu], and stem:[s^2] is
      an unbiased estimate of the variance stem:[sigma^2] of that distribution. The
      expression stem:[s//sqrt(n)] is an estimate of the standard deviation of the
      distribution of stem:[bar q] and is called the experimental standard deviation
      of the mean.
