  notes:
  - content: The main beam is also defined as 2.5 times 3 dB beamwidth for mathematical
      computation of antenna main beam efficiency.
  - content: The width of main beam (which is commonly called "null to null beamwidth")
      is defined as the angular span between the first pattern nulls (the magnitude
      of the radiation pattern decreases to zero, negative infinity dB) adjacent to
      the main lobes.
