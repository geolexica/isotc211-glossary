  definition:
  - content: ratio of the number of child cells to parent cells
  examples: []
  id: '2439'
  notes:
  - content: A positive integer ratio stem:[n] refinement of DGGS parent cells yield
      n times as many child cells as parent cells.
  - content: For a two-dimensional DGGS (as defined for EAERS in this document) this
      is the surface area ratio.
  - content: In DGGS literature [34] the term aperture has been used instead of refinement
      ratio. Refinement ratio is preferred because it is clearer in meaning to audiences
      outside the early DGGS community.
