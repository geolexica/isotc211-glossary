  id: '2751'
  notes:
  - content: Repeatability or stability of a measurement between adjacent samples
      or within a single integrated measurement interval is referred to as "short-term"
      repeatability. Short-term repeatability is quantified from measurement noise
      with a timescale of typically seconds to minutes.
  - content: Repeatability or stability of response from a stable input between consecutive
      or succeeding integrated measurement intervals is referred to as "medium-term"
      repeatability. Medium-term repeatability is typically quantified via benchmark
      tests that are included as part of a measurement sequence. Medium-term repeatability
      sources may include on-board stimulator sources, vicarious ground sources and
      stellar references. The medium-term repeatability timescale is typically minutes
      to hours.
  - content: Repeatability or stability between widely separated measurement intervals
      is referred to as "long-term" repeatability. Long-term repeatability is typically
      quantified via benchmark tests that periodically measure constant radiometric
      source(s) over the life of the sensor. Long-term repeatability sources may include
      on-board stimulator sources, vicarious ground sources and stellar references.
      The long-term repeatability timescale is typically hours to days, up to the
      lifetime of the sensor.
