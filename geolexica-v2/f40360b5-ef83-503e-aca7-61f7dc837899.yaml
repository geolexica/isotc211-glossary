  id: '2707'
  notes:
  - content: Methods or techniques described as good practice have usually been tested
      over time and validated, in the broad sense, through repeated trials before
      being accepted as worthy of adoption more broadly.
  - content: A good practice is typically derived from practitioners who work in a
      specified field, e.g. in the assignment and maintenance of addresses and address
      data, after it has been proven in practice.
  - content: Even though a good practice is only recommended as a model, if it is
      followed, then some parts or aspects of it may be required. Therefore, the requirements
      specified for a good practice in this document are conditional requirements,
      i.e. they are required only if the good practice is followed.
