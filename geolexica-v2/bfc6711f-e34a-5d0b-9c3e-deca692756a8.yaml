  notes:
  - content: The primitives of zone are spatial location (3.31) and temporal period
      (3.34).
  - content: A zone may be either a single zonal primitive or a compound zone comprising
      one spatial location and one temporal period. Zones can be regions of space-time
      associated with any celestial body.
  - content: Zones are the primary container for storing and retrieving data within
      a DGGS implementation. DGGSs reference zones by their zonal identifier (3.50),
      for instance in databases or through tile nomenclature.
  - content: Each zone's geometry is represented by a cell
