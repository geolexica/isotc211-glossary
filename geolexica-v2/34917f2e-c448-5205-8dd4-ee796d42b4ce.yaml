      For microwave radiometer, SRF refers to the receiver's band-pass, stem:[B(nu)], which can be determined by performing two measurements per frequency at different input power levels, as shown in the following formula: stem:[B(nu)=(DeltaV_("out")(nu))/(DeltaP_("in")(nu))]

      where

      stem:[DeltaV_("out")] is the output voltage difference;
      stem:[DeltaP_("in")] is the input power difference;
      stem:[nu] is the frequency in Hz
