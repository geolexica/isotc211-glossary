    type: accepted
  definition:
  - content: data which are not obtained from the sensor itself (usually provided
      in the science telemetry) and have the primary purpose to serve the processing
      of instrument data
  examples: []
  id: '2491'
  notes:
  - content: Ancillary data refers to data that exist purely to serve the data processing.
      Auxiliary data, while helping the process, are also datasets in their own right.
  - content: Ancillary data may be 'engineering', 'core housekeeping' or 'subsystem'
      data obtained from other parts of the measurement platform. It may include parameters
      such as position and velocity, attitude and its range of change, time, temperatures,
      pressures, internally produced magnetic fields, and other environmental measurements.
  - content: Some missions may treat ancillary data as datasets in their own right,
      thus blurring the distinction being made here between ancillary and auxiliary
      data.
  - content: The definition in the original source is tailored to spaceborne Earth
      observations. It has been slightly modified here to be more general. The concept
      is that ancillary data are those not collected by the sensor itself and that
      their primary purpose to serve processing applies to Earth observation data
      from airborne and in situ instruments as well.
