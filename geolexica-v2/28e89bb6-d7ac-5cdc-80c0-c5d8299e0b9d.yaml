  notes:
  - content: Good service delivery provides clients with an increase in value. The
      provision of sufficient, affordable and quality basic services is considered
      a core function of governments. Service delivery, e.g. water, sanitation, waste
      management and housing, correlates closely with the health and well-being of
      citizens.
