  - content: homogeneous (all points have isomorphic neighborhoods) and with a simple
      boundary

  notes:
  - content: The interior is everywhere locally isomorphic to an open disc in a Euclidean
      coordinate space of the appropriate dimension `D^n = {P | norm P < 1.0}`. The
      boundary is a dimension one smaller. This essentially means that the object
      does not intersect nor touch itself. Generally used for a curve that does not
      cross not touch itself with the possible exception of boundary points. Simple
      closed curves are isomorphic to a circle.
