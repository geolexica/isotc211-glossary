  notes:
  - content: Typically for LIDAR, sufficient calibration has not been done to calculate
      absolute intensity, so relative intensity is usually reported.  In linear mode
      systems, this value is typically provided as an integer, resulting from a mapping
      of the return’s signal power to an integer value via a lookup table.
